In the nicest way possible before experts diagnose my very own bod let me just state this: 
1. I don’t suffer from IBS
2. I’m not in any physical discomfort 3. I don’t binge/ this was not a result of eating loads of ‘crap food’ 
4. I’m not intolerant to any type of food, except slightly allergic to bs 
-
Let me also just point out that for sure, on the left I’m standing in a way to accentuate my body (let me work the angles ok xx). The right, I’m just straight up taking a pic to show you that I too look like this at certain points in the day. Now if you are perplexed by these photos, this is a result of consuming a high volume of (healthy*) food - oh & alot of drink. I’m making this post because people assume I look the way I do in my posts 24/7 or misinterpret these posts of mine. When you eat food it has to go somewhere *meet the food baby*. Also, the leaner a person is, the more visible said food baby becomes. Infact, upon taking these (after food) pics my bf often mocks me for how visible the meal is, as if he can make out the smoked salmon & grains are slowly making their way down my bod 😂😂 but then in contrast you’d never be able to tell if he’s eaten or not if we were to compare even straight after eating the same meal. I guess I just wanted to remind you that our body’s fluctuate throughout the day & it’s normal so don’t feel bogged down for looking different at the end of the day Vs the morning. 💕
Ps. Of course if you experience discomfort / other symptoms upon eating certain foods, get this checked. I’m only sharing my personal experience as we are all different. But food does have to still go somewhere.. xxxxxxxx

The whole purpose of me being here was too support and open the tour for the bro and now that is completed it’s time for me to go home

I first came to Australia when I was 17 and I’ll always have a connection here and although I love visiting and seeing friends I’ve never been happier to go home to London to my family and friends.

I loved every minute of it from the moment I did my two week quarantine which I loved 😂 all the way up to the last event

Thank you to each individual that came to the shows, thank you Austrailia for letting me in and thank you for allowing me to have some normality.

I can’t wait to land in London and start a new chapter of this crazy journey ❤️

When I started training clients, most of the other personal trainers I knew were in the same boat. They already had the basics nailed down and were looking at fine tuning the little details to get the most from their fitness plan.

If something was ""optimal"", we wanted to know. Was there a “best” time of the day to train? Did organic vegetables have a higher micronutrient content than conventional? Is consuming 1.8g/kg/day protein better than 1.6g/kg/day?

One day, I was training a client and they said ""I will never get good results in the gym. I don't want to be as meticulous as you are. I still want to go out for drinks and pizza with my friends. I still want to have a social life"".

Right then I had the big slap in the face I needed to realise that I worried about a lot of shit that just didn't matter for most people.

On social media, we are constantly discussing ""optimal"" macronutrient splits, whether HIIT is ""better"" than low intensity cardio, whether eating 6 meals per day might offer a teeny tiny bit of a ""metabolic advantage"" than eating 3 meals per day and other shit like that.

For a lot of people, nutrition and training advice is confusing as fuck and they just need to know where to begin.

While we sometimes engage in mental masturbation over the finer details, ask yourself these questions?

- What percentage of people exercise more than 3 times per week?
- What percentage of people are not eating enough fruits and vegetables?
- What percentage of people would benefit from just eating more protein, without worrying about whether they should spread their meals out to optimally raise muscle protein synthesis levels or whether their last meal hit the magical leucine threshold?
- What percentage of people would benefit from focusing more on unprocessed foods, rather than getting scalded for eating a single Krispy Kreme doughnut

Let’s not focus so much on what is “best” if it comes at the expense of just telling people what is “better”.","Ben Carpenter @bdccarpenter Theory: Lots of people enter the fitness industry because they are hardcore exercise enthusiasts, not realising they have no fucking idea on how to empathise with people who aren't hardcore exercise enthusiasts.",,,8.89,8.89,3.3

Years of being crotch-deep in diet culture.
And years on unpicking all of the lies it told me.⠀

I built my own app. my creation of what I think a fitness app should be in 2021. A fitness app which hopefully doesn’t make you feel like shit !⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Here’s what to expect:⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀

• 6 brand new workout guides
• Gym, home + backpack guides
• Sessions you’ll actually enjoy
• Select your ability level + workout frequency
• Track your weights + log your workouts
• Recipes made by an *actual* chef • No white-label recipes, all custom made
• For vegans, veggies, pescies + meat-eatersies • No meal plans, no calorie counting • Daily pep-talks
• Workout library of stand-alone workouts⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Oh and -⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
• No diet culture • No burpees • No bullshit⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
:) ⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
And this just the beginning of what I have planned for you.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
I’ll save other bits for tomorrow because character limit. But yeah. Nobs. Thank you.⠀

I’m bored of people being made to feel like they need to count calories, entering their food into a little app. I’m bored of people being made to feel like they need to follow 2 wk body transformations. Which can easily be done, when they’re fake. I’m bored of people feeling like they need to spend the weekends prepping the same bland meals. Even Stan hates it! Do you ever feel like working out at your own pace? Whilst also living a life? So I made an app with none of that stuff in, just an app which hopefully doesn’t make you feel shit.

From pandemics to hangovers I decided to take some variables that influenced that into my own hands and give up something that gave me pleasure for a lifestyle that may make me happier as a byproduct. 

I don’t have a booze problem at all, I just set out to lift my self-standards a bit and I’ve enjoyed it to be honest, it’s not been easy at all. 

I’m not setting a time frame on this gap from  drinking but it’s nice only living with one personality for a few months 😂 (the other personality being the fucking idiot version of yourself when you drink.)

On the left I was around 16. I hated my body and over the next few years everything I did was centred around striving to lose — lose weight, lose a dress side, lose calories from my day, lose something I didn’t like about my body and so on. I learned the hard way that if you’re always trying to LOSE, how are you ever going to truly WIN?
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I don’t recognise the me on the left anymore. Not because of how much I’ve physically changed, but because of how I know I felt and treated my body. I didn’t get here through focusing on what I had to lose but instead chasing ALL there was to gain. A lifestyle to love which makes me feel strong and powerful, a body to cherish and respect, an appetite to feed and fuel — and so so much more.

Shaming people for wanting to lose weight is also NOT OK! 😤⁣
⁣
I think the health at every size (HAES) movement has several positive aspects to it. They are right in that diet culture can be very harmful & dangerous for certain people. They are right in that you can still practice healthy habits even if you are overweight or obese (btw if you practice health y habits, the likelyhood or losing weight increases... just saying). And there is evidence you can be overweight & still be healthy so long as you lose a small amount of weight & exercise frequently & practice other health lifestyle habits⁣
⁣
But then some HAES extemeists say shit like “calorie deficits don’t work” or “long term weight loss is impossible” 🙄 or that obesity has absolutely NO negative health ramifications 🙄. Listen, I’m not for making people feel bad about their weight. But I’m also against utter bullshit. Hell, I had a HAES extremist chew me out for being a nutrition coach & “part of diet culture.” Never mind I’ve helped contribute to eating disorder research, been an advocate for those with eating disorders, & routinely convince people NOT to diet 🤷🏼‍♂️
⁣
This just demonstrates that small minded people can become extremists about ANYTHING. Losing weight is difficult & keeping it off more difficult? TRUE? Calorie deficits don’t work? Absolute horseshit 🤨🙄. Shaming people helps no one. Bullshitting also helps no one⁣
⁣
Here’s an idea, how about some of you mind your own fucking business & not insert your opinion when people don’t ask you 🤷🏼‍♂️

In fact, most people who ‘shame’ are doing so out of their own insecurity. You hate diet culture? Great. That doesn’t make it ok to shit on someone who wants to lose weight. Mind yo damned business","Layne Norton, PhD @BioLayne Wanting to ose weight doesn't make you a bad person Tracking your food or restricting your food in some way is not an eating disorder Fat shaming is terrible.

Ben was a very gullible teenager and believed what some ""trusted"" people told him. He was not familiar with researching things himself, which later in life he found quite a joyous hobby.

He frequently succumbed to fitness industry misinformation, and before he knew it, he was avoiding a long list of foods for reasons that had been very strongly exaggerated.

People selling the damaging effects of sugar, as if one teaspoon in your coffee would make you store body fat and give you instant type 2 diabetes.

Ben did not understand that something could result in deleterious effects *in excess* yet be benign in moderated quantities. Just because chocolate isn't the healthiest food in the world, doesn't mean that you have to strictly avoid it for the rest of your life.

Ben was inadvertently caught in a dangerous spiral where he avoided lots of foods temporarily, only to find himself periodically wanting to binge eat on them again. He realised life was a lot better when he didn't have unnecessary food paranoia, and could eat foods he wanted in moderation without feeling the urge to commit compensatory-death-by-chocolate after avoiding it for the past month.

He decided to make it his mission to stop people falling for the same traps he did, so they could understand that ""fitness"" didn't have to come at the expense of mental health or actually having a fucking social life.

You can simultaneously acknowledge that you probably shouldn't eat massive quantities of particular foods yet still not feel the need to strictly avoid them, they are not synonymous.

Happy Easter ❤️

Lol sorry, serious question now guys, if you had to choose just the one CRONUT, are you going for Terry’s chocolate orange, Oreo or the biscoff one?! If you’ve caught up on my latest YouTube video you’ll have seen me taste test these absolutely incredible creations. If not, here’s the news flash: @wenzelsthebakers have launched Cronuts! They are glazed, sandwiched with Nutella & the crunch from the pastry is enough to start an ASMR channel 🤣🤣 (no, not launching anytime soon - too much of a chatterbox for that). Also, SO easy/ tidy/ neat to eat..not messy at all.. not sticky whatsoever.. you defo don’t get sugar in your eyelashes..... 
(swipe 😳) That just me?
Ps. You can get your hands/ eyelashes on the cronut action via UberEats - link in latest yt vid! Pps. I wouldn’t advise eating cronuts everyday but I do advocate for including the odd beauty / treat throughout the week

So, I was having the best build up of my life, and 12 days out I had a minor adductor/medial ham strain. No warning signs, I was feeling great and it was with a back off set. It felt better daily, but forced me to more aggressively taper than I normally do on squat and deadlift. I kept pushing bench and hit a lifetime PB paused 155 eight days out...and strained my pec 😑. Again, no warning signs, feeling great. This bummed me out, reminded me how little control we actually have. I backed off, got an ultrasound that confirmed it was as minor as I thought (but still a small tear) and took it day by day going by pain. I hit 110 pain free 3 days out, so I decided on game day to do 120 then go by feel. But the wind was out of my sails, I wanted to skip the meet. 
I’m glad I didn’t. My ham/adductor was totally back to normal, and the aggressive taper worked. The heaviest squat in my build up was 212.5 and just 200 after the strain. Squats flew on the platform, but we played it safe and I smoked 220kg (I have no idea what I said in the video lol). Bench also was a pleasant surprise, 120 was pain free, as was 130, and then 140! I got back up to my planned opener and most importantly, my pec is still attached lol. At this point I knew I was safe to let rip on deadlifts. After I pulled 230 and 245 the fastest I ever had, we loaded 260 for a 10kg PB deadlift, which I barely got and unbelievably also got a 2.5kg PB total. I went from not wanting to compete to having the best meet of my life, even with a conservative squat, and leaving 15kg off bench🤯 
So, lessons learned, shit happens.

Also. I did have the *fab* idea of making a peri chicken salad of dreams however realised a key ingredient was missing for a salad.. lettuce 😅. That said, we pulled through homies. Contents of bowl include: nandos chicken, grated carrot, pickled beetroot, sweetcorn, half an avocado, red onion, gherkins, orange pepper, cucumber, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, pickled chilli peppers + salad cream + perinaise. It was a beautiful thing, give it a go (although croutons or crushed up cool original Doritos were missing today*). 
Anyway. Dinner preparations are about to commence. Shame it’s not yetttt quite BBQ weather else that would be on the cards. If you fancy summing up your day in emojis, go ahead.

Quit wasting your money on fat burners, diarrhea teas and detox bullshit.
.
Start doing the obvious things you probably aren’t spending enough time on.
.
Most importantly, remove the negative people from your life.
.
Immediately.
.
Someone recently asked me how much I think genetics impact your ability to lose body fat.
.
I said genetics impact everything in life.
.
But when it comes to fat loss, genetics are no where near as important as your environment.
.
I think this holds true for pretty much everything.
.
Yes, your genetics play a role in determining your ceiling for potential.
.
But most people never get anywhere close to that ceiling and much of it has to do with who you choose to surround yourself with.
.
You owe nothing to no one except yourself.
.
Put yourself in a situation and environment that allows you to achieve everything you’ve ever wanted.

HAHA JUST KIDDING! But seriously though don’t feel bad. There are people who actually believe the law of thermodynamics isn’t a thing 🤣

Or that insulin makes you gain body fat in a calorie deficit 🤣

Or that fasting is the secret to longevity 🤣

Or people like @marksissonprimal using the word ‘metabolic flexibility’ repeatedly without really understanding it

Let’s take that last one since it’s hot. Metabolic flexibility is the ability to use both carbohydrates and fats as fuel. You know what low carb diets do? Make you LESS metabolically flexible. In fact, just a short duration of a ketogenic diet will impair glucose tolerance as assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test PMID: 32109885

You know what increases metabolic flexibility? Eating a balanced diet, exercising, and not having excess adipose tissue 🤷🏼‍♂️

Don’t buy into hucksters using nebulous terms they don’t understand. Always ask yourself the following questions when someone makes a claim:

1) Compared to what?

2) What is the cost? (Everything is a trade off)

3) Where is your HARD, DIRECT evidence to support your claim.

The bigger the claim, the more rigid these 3 must be fulfilled. 

Shoutout to @thethomassowell for those 3 pillars

Don’t buy into hype bullshit. There are no hacks. No quick fixes. Not unless you want to take drugs & then there is another cost that will have to be paid

Consistency. Hard work. Dedication. 

The magic you are looking for is in the WORK you keep trying to avoid

Get to fucking work & KEEP GOING❤️",,,,4.43,4.43,3.53

Wishing my beautiful firstborn Jeremiah Thomas a happy 5th birthday!
My boy you're one in a million, you make me so proud each and every day and there are so many wonderful things I want to say about you.

Instead, I want to share one of our most recent car chats because your little innocent mind has a wonderful way of making the weight of the world seem ok. I hope this brightens everyone's day as it did mine.

Miah asked, “Mum, is your cup empty?”
I replied “My cup? What do you mean?”
Miah replied “Your cup in your heart. Everyone's heart has a cup. When somebody doesn't like you or say nice things to you, your cup in your heart empties & you become sad. But when people like you & say nice things to you, it fills your cup up and you are happy.”

I stopped for a second and thought, how simple and perfect was this little boys motive to being kind & friendly. If we all thought about how our actions affect others “heart-cups” we would think before we speak and make time to potentially fill as many cups as we can. Eventually, this would become second nature, a habit I personally think is valuable to have.

Jeremiah, thank you for making me a mum, I love you ❤️ @the.duncan.family_",,,,4.38,4.38,7.32

- fitness models are in good shape as a living, you’re not

- every young person wants to be in great shape, only a fraction have the dedication and genetic blessings to make it for a living

- when all your bills are paid by your physique you develop serious issues with your relationship to food (or lack of)

- if you were unlucky enough to not be in the 1% of insane genetics, less than 1% of those taking genetic enhancers 💉 would admit they’re “assisted”

People don’t use me as a personal trainer just because I’m white. 

People don’t buy my books because I’m male. 

Having “my gender correspond with my birth sex” did not sell out my last tour. 

Being heterosexual did not make me a #1 Sunday Times Best seller. 

Being able bodied is something I pay into every day with training and good dieting. 

What the woke cunts see as privilege is more often than not hard work. 

Yeah, it helps you sleep at night pointing the finger at any category you can slot me in for your ideological beliefs. 

Ten years ago I was working knocking door to door sales in a cold UK winter waiting for this moment. 

I’ve sacrificed so much for my work, family time, relationships and I haven’t had a day off or a sick day in over 5 years. 

So from the bottom of my heart; fuck you. 

If we continue to discriminate against hard work as “privilege” we’re gonna create an even softer generation to the one we live in now. 

People without the capacity to work hard hiding behind the guise of social justice. 

You can suck my privileged cisgender testicles. 

Labelling me as all these things is making the situation WORSE. 

I see humanity as one, I don’t pick people apart on their sexual preference or skin colour and I certainly don’t discriminate against anyone from what I see on face value.

Don’t mistake hard work and dedication for privilege, your kids may thank me in 10 years time. 

Not today you woke cunts, not today. 😂🤙🏽

Let's take the humble potato. On it's own when it is plain, it has a very high satiety score (actually the highest out of all the foods studied) which means that talented little bugger fills you up more than most foods on the planet. Great news for people trying to regulate their appetite when dieting.

But things change with processing, once you fry that little bugger in some oil or butter and add some seasonings, it definitely gets more delicious, less satiating and more calorie dense meaning there is a strong likelihood you will want to eat more.

When you take that processing further and deep fry it in oil, what started out as a humble satiety-promoting potato can turn into some of the most ""addictive-like"" foods on the planet.

Same potato, but now it has a higher fat content, a completely different texture, less fibre and more flavour.

Whilst everyone is pointing the finger exclusively at sugary foods for being bad for appetite regulation, they may overlook the bazillion other factors that can transform even the most boring food into something that is super fucking tasty and seemingly impossible to stop eating.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

There is so much wrong with this, I am not quite sure where to begin.

In the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, subjects were rationed on a low-calorie diet coming from foods that were typically available in war-torn areas of Europe, consisting of potatoes, bread, turnips, macaroni and rutabaga (swede). In this extreme experiment, subjects lost a quarter of their body weight, despite it being a very carbohydrate heavy diet. (PMID of secondary paper: 15930436).

One guy, called Andrew Taylor (cc @spudfit), decided to eat nothing but potatoes for a year and lost 117lbs.

Potatoes, when served plain, have a high ""satiety index"". When given isocaloric portions of 38 different foods before being given access to a buffet, eating boiled potatoes resulted in the lowest subsequent intake of food, indicating that potatoes were more filling and therefore good for regulating appetite. (PMID 7498104).

People sometimes focus so much on blood sugar and insulin levels they completely overlook the role of calorie balance. Even sugar consumption doesn't result in weight gain when consumed in the context of a calorie controlled diet. (PMID 9094871).

I don't believe I actually need to clarify this but no, potatoes will not automatically ""make you fat"".

Can we please stop this unnecessary food paranoia?

I was 27, no mortgage, no savings and off backpacking to Australia as my mates were settling down and doing ‘the right thing’.

I felt like I was a bit broken, unsettled almost. But reading this quote backed what I already felt for so much of my adult life.

That it’s better to be in a bunkbed figuring it out, than in a shared bed with someone wishing I hadn’t. 

There’s nothing wrong with settling down in your twenties, but there’s also nothing wrong with doing nothing but figuring out who you are and what you want to do in your twenties. 

I’m 31 years old. I’ve only had a job I love for 7 of those, I have another 30-40 years left of working. 

The point I’m trying to make is that you have to construct your life to how you want to live it; not what is the ‘right thing to do’ by societal norms. 

Ultimately you need to do what you want to do. 

Not where you think you should be at this stage in your life. 

If you’re on the fence, remember. 

‘Don’t cling on to a mistake just because you spent a long time making it.’

I make many posts talking about why calories in vs calories out (CICO) & why it matters, so let’s talk about why people THINK they are eating in a calorie deficit & not losing weight🤔

First, CICO is what is. Conservation of energy is a FUNDAMENTAL LAW of nature/physics. If you aren’t losing weight (over the LONG TERM, not talking short term fluid fluctuations) that means you aren’t in a calorie deficit. If you believe you should be that means you are either taking in more calories than you think or expending less energy than you think, or both. Swipe right 👉🏼

1st let’s talk calories in. Research shows that in people who claim they eat low kcal (~1200/d) & couldn’t lose weight were actually underestimating their intake by 50%! They also overestimate their activity by 50% as well! 😱 This can feel very attacking to people but check out my 2nd slide. I’m not saying people are lying. People are just really shit at estimating & also forget to account for foods that they think don’t matter. But these untracked or incorrectly tracked foods can wind up as hundreds of kcal/d if not MORE. If you think you are on low kcal not losing weight, try weighing & tracking every single thing you put in your mouth for 2 weeks. You’ll be shocked

3rd slide is from my book, Fat Loss Forever & is those who are weekend over eaters. Sorry guys, calories still matter on the weekend 🤷🏼‍♂️. Not saying you can’t have higher calorie days on fat loss so long as you budget for them, you can but you must understand how it affects your weekly calorie budget. This is why we created the calorie planner feature in @carbondietcoach to make it easy to map out your weekly intake. This doesn’t even touch on the fact many people drink on the weekend & don’t track the kcal from alcohol which itself has 7 kcal/g & 5 drinks can EASILY rack up 800+ kcal you didn’t account for

Finally, many people claim they burn thousands of calories per day in activity based on their activity monitors, but these devices have been shown to overestimate energy expenditure by 30-93%! Just because your watch says you burned it don't mean shit!",,,,3.67,3.67,2.98

.
No.
.
Not at all.
.
I’ll tell you why.
.
Maintaining that level of leanness was purely for my ego.
.
➡️ I didn’t perform better when I had a six pack.
.
➡️ I didn’t feel better when I had a six pack.
.
➡️ I didn’t have more energy when I had a six pack.
.
➡️ I wasn’t healthier when I had a six pack.
.
I had to be way more strict with my nutrition.
.
I was, ironically, more self conscious and critical of my physique.
.
And the sole purpose of maintaining such a low level of body fat was to feed my ego when I took my shirt off in public or shared pics on IG.
.
I’m not gonna say that’s the “wrong” way to live.
.
But I am gonna say that’s no longer what I value and definitely not how I choose to live anymore.
.
Fuck. My. Ego.
.
And fuck anyone who gives a shit if I’m 8% body fat or 15% body fat.
.
No, I don’t miss being that lean.
.
At all.
.
Because I’m much happier with a slightly higher body fat percentage, significantly more energy, more pizza, more fun out with friends, and less feeding my ego over shit that, candidly, doesn’t fucking matter.
.
So, yeah.
.
That’s why I don’t miss having a 6-pack.

Seriously.

Stop trying to lose a quick 10lbs three days before Joe Fuckstick’s annual weenie roast.

Stop creating and forcing yourself into arbitrary deadlines by which you convince yourself you “need” to lose x amount of weight.

Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to lose an obscene amount of weight as quickly as possible.

Stop perpetuating this false idea that makes it seem like you need to lose it now or never.

It’s not “now or never.”

It’s not a “one and done” process.

It takes time.

A lot of time.

This is a “forever” kind of thing.

And the more you try to speed things up or lose weight faster or take magical fat burning pills or invest in motherfucking Fit Tea for fucks sake...the further you drive yourself away from reaching your goal.

Listen.

It’s not sexy or marketable or fun or easy...but it’s the truth.

This. Game. Is. Forever.

It never ends.

You will get better at it. It will get easier. You will get to a point where you don’t have to consciously think about it all the time.

But when it’s all said and done, this game never ends.

So enjoy it. Invest in the process. Give yourself the best opportunity to succeed.

And remember...if you aren’t having fun, what’s the point?

Well it worked for me, about ten years ago I decided to sort my life out now do the same for tens of thousands of people a year. 

I didn’t gain it all back.
I didn’t have a poor relationship with food.
I feel better at 31 than I did at 21.

Health is your responsibility and people need to step up. Not everyone has equal access to health as others, sure. 

But blanket prescribing ‘dieting doesn’t work’ is like saying no one should ever do anal because someone had a bad experience. 

Maybe I’m bias because “diet culture” was the best fucking thing that ever happened to me. 

Maybe I’m bias because I meet people and hug people who have changed their identity and daily habits after periods of dieting and training.

Maybe I’m bias because I love my life way more with weights and moderation in the middle of it. 

Diets do work, if you work with them. 

If you don’t do the work required, I can see as to why you may have a different conclusion to I do.

“But James, you always see obese people drinking diet coke, what do you make of that?”

Association is not causation. 

Diet drinks are a great part of a fat loss strategy. But before you say “not as good as water.” 

Shut the fuck up for a minute and realise familiarity is a big player in adherence and sustainability. 

“Swaps” within someone’s existing diet is a strategy I’ve used with clients for years. Too many coaches sell their own diet to their clients. 

They wonder why the wheels fall off a couple weeks in when the client can’t even look at a plain chicken breast let alone broccoli. 🥦

People say dumb shit, remember, you can still be a fucking moron with a 6pac.

Low calorie alternatives are harmless and play a fantastic part in calorie reductions when striving for a calorie deficit.

They go on to say maintaining a consistent heart rate during race performance is critical in keeping the Psychobiological Model of Fatigue in balance.

⁣
I owe this amazement to something called NSV.⁣
⁣
When you learn how to acknowledge NSV, you can improve your confidence and quality of life exponentially. So, take notes and let this sink in!⁣
⁣
NSV is a little abbreviation for something called a Non-Scale Victory. ⁣
⁣
These are victories in health, fitness, and life that have NOTHING to do with body weight.⁣
⁣
It’s easy to get caught up in measures that are seemingly quantifiable (like your weight on the scale) because it’s specific and measurable.⁣
⁣
However...⁣
✔️What is specific doesn’t always see context.⁣
👉Will a certain number actually = more happiness, confidence, and the desired look? Not necessarily and probably not. You are more than a number.⁣
⁣
⁣
✔️What is measurable doesn’t always read accurately. ⁣
👉Just because the scale goes up or doesn’t move, doesn’t mean you aren’t making progress. It could be temporary water retention or more sweet, sweet muscle!⁣
⁣
💡It’s important to open up the mindset into a world that sees context, understands nuance, and builds a strong, flexible foundation. ⁣
⁣
Goal setting is great, but also understanding goals from a more holistic perspective will make ALL the difference.⁣
⁣
💕That’s why I love NSV. Every time I can do one heavier rep, finish a workout a little faster, eat pizza without guilt or shame, give someone encouragement in their own journey... I know that I am making myself a little bit better than I was yesterday.⁣
⁣
We are unique, strong, and special for so many reasons outside of how our bodies look and the weight of our gravitational pull.⁣
⁣
It’s important to see and celebrate everything that we accomplish.⁣
⁣
There are so many types of Non-Scale Victories to be celebrated. Nothing is to small or insignificant. Celebrate every victory because you are worth it!⁣

I’ve got a PhD in nutrition. I LOVE nutrition. I, like many others thought for a long time that nutrition was the most important factor for building muscle & overall health

WRONG

Try to build muscle just with nutrition & let me know how that goes. You can add very modest amounts of lean body mass through nutrition & only by adding body weight typically.

If you’ve never resistance trained you can add muscle & lose fat while doing nothing else. Nutrition can’t do that

And yet, I can’t tell you how many people I see online who want to pick apart every nuance with nutrition but do not even resistance train or exercise. 🤦🏼‍♂️. Stepping over dollars to pick up pennies

I’m not saying they are mutually exclusive. They aren’t. They work best together. But resistance training is amazing for

-Building muscle
-Improving strength
-Preventing sarcopenia
-Decreases cancer risk
-Decreases CVD risk
-Increases bone mineral density
-Decreases risk of several other diseases
-Muscle mass is also a predictor of mortality after age 65, people with more muscle live longer
-May have cognitive benefits

It ain’t just for meatheads and vain people. It’s for overall health too. It’s one of the best, if not the best thing you can do for your health

1) you gonna be rocking heels / cute outfits or trainers / activewear when normal life returns?? 👀 (🌮 or staying in in taco slippers?! 😏) 
2) hitting the pub or gym first??

That’s right, I said it. Evidence for this comes from several meta-analysis showing zero difference in fat loss or gain when calories are equated between low sugar and high sugar diets.

In fact Surwit et al 2001 demonstrated in a tightly controlled multi month randomized controlled trial that sugar didn’t make one iota ie difference in fat loss. They had 2 groups: one low sugar (~10g/d) and another at over 100g per day. Same macros. Same calories. 

Know what they found? BOTH groups LOST ALMOST THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF FAT 🤷🏼‍♂️. 

Not only that but both groups had nearly identical improvements in markers of health (blood lipids, glucose, blood pressure). The only thing that improved more in the low sugar group was LDL cholesterol which improved slightly more on the low sugar group. Likely due to the low sugar group eating significantly more fiber, but the difference was quite small in LDL reduction. 

Now I don’t think eating a ton of sugar is a great idea for fat loss because sugar is not very satiating and some people have a hard time limiting it.

Further, there is no evidence for sugar addiction in humans (please see scientific review paper of the same title). Foods that fit the definition of causing ‘food dependence’ have high sugar AND fat AND are usually ultra processed. Sugar alone does not rank high on the food dependence scale. In fact of single(ish) macronutrient foods, foods high in fat like nuts & seeds rank much higher than sugar alone 🤷🏼‍♂️

Long story short: sugar doesn’t make you fat in absence of over consuming total calories.

This is nearly 5 years into my journey.
A journey which has shaped me into the strong, confident woman I once dreamt of being.
The process is slow with its ups and downs but quitting will not speed it up!!!
.
I hear it all the time! “I will never get a body like that” “I wish I had your confidence”.
Well here’s the thing, you really can if you are willing to change. You have to break out of bad habits and create new ones, you have to learn not to quit when you fail, you have to take risks!!!
Your body is capable of anything, it’s your mind you have to convince. 
Start replacing ‘I will never’ with I WILL!!!
.
My advice would be to get a properly structured program that is designed to get you results. Follow a sustainable meal plan which allows you to actually eat food that’s enjoyable. It doesn’t have to be one of mine but trust me, having something to follow will keep you accountable. I wish I had done this back when I first started instead of figuring it all out the hard and long way.

When the KD began gaining popularity years ago, besides all the magical diet claims that circulated the internet, many folks also postulated that exercise performance could be improved due to people being ‘fat adapted.’

So what does the research say? When it comes to ultra endurance work & endurance work at lower intensities, the KD does not seem to impair performance, but also doesn’t seem to enhance it, with no differences at 60% of VO2 Max but significant decreases in time to exhaustion (TTE) at 70% of VO2 Max on the KD (Shaw et al 2019)

This makes sense because we know that higher intensity exercise relies more on carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation & in the case of anaerobic exercise like strength training & high intensity exercise, CHO MUST be used as fatty acid metabolism requires oxygen

When it comes to resistance training & gaining LBM, there are only a few studies examining this. The two best are from Vargas et al (2019 & 2020) comparing protein matched KD vs non ketogenic diets (NKD) & looking at body composition & strength outcomes after several months. In both studies, the KD group gained less LBM than the NKD groups (was only statistically significant in 2019 study) & in the 2020 study the subjects increases in strength on the squat & bench press were significantly impaired by the KD (swipe for a figure from the 2020 study) 👉🏼

Burke et al 2017 found that a KD impaired exercise performance in competitive race walkers. Even though fatty acid oxidation was significantly enhanced by the KD diet, it also increased the oxygen cost of exercise. Makes sense because they were at 90% of VO2 Max

Zinn et al showed performance reductions in endurance athletes following a KD despite increased fat oxidation & improvements in body composition. Athletes subjectedly reported more fatigue initially, but even after reporting their energy had returned, their mean TTE was reduced by ~2 minutes from the KD

What does it mean? It means that if strength or speed is your goal, a KD diet is likely suboptimal. You can get stronger & faster on one, but likely not as much as a diet that contains CHO",,,,3.11,3.11,2.5

It’s mad how people worry about sharks and spiders yet work jobs that don’t fulfil them, live a life without meaning and endure huge amounts of stress on a daily basis.

Rather than worrying about the water you swim in, worry about the environment you exist in. You wouldn’t put a plant in the shade and neglect watering it if you cared about it. 

Sleep well, be active, don’t engage in activities that negate your mental wellbeing for a short hit of pleasure. 

Be selfish when you need to be, share how you’re feeling with close friends and do what’s right for you - not what everyone else seems to be doing. 

Mad how you’d be worried in a statistically safe place (the sea) where drowning is more of a threat than sharks. 

Your biggest fears should be constructing a life you don’t love living. It’s never too late to change who you are or what you want to do each day. 

Let sharks live. 😂

You should be worried about your daily actions and habits more than an apex predator lurking in the sea.

Nobs. Thank you so much. This feels really emotional :’) Just wanted to share some images of what to expect from your app (!) I wanted your user experience to feel light and seamless. No fuss. Hope you like it :’) @nobsapp ⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
nobs exists because I wanted to create a place where fitness wasn’t just about what you body looks like - but how it makes you feel.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Autonomy to do whatever the fuck you want with your body is essential. This includes aesthetic goals such as weight loss.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
But there aren’t enough pockets of fitness for people who just want to follow a great, solid training programme, get stronger, eat food and live their lives.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
No restriction, no counting, no rules.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
So I made one.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Nobs is a lifestyle in the most basic sense - in that I actually couldn’t care less about transforming your life.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
That’s not what I’m here to do.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
I just want nobs to slot nicely into the one you already know and love.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
And give you a community where ironically, we largely talk about everything but how much we deadlift lol. #NFR ;)⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
This app is dedicated to each and every single person who has joined the community in the past 3 years, and made it what it is today. That’s on all of you. Thank you.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
This is just the beginning too. This is version 1. The start of the journey. And I have so much in store for you.

And more often than not, doing one small thing is enough to keep your motivation going so you keep crushing it tomorrow rather than falling off track altogether.

Don’t give yourself an excuse to quit.

It’s not worth it and you’ll never look back and be happy you gave yourself the easy way out.

Let me give you my nutty take on this. Life = a constant blending of nut butters. It’s loud. It’s fast paced. As a result of the noise it’s very easy to miss your blender amongst the others. Especially as we are all trying so hard to keep up to speed with the others. What we don’t realise is that if we were to turn ours off, readjust the nuts that go into the mix, we’d most definitely be overall more efficient in the long run. Less cloggy. We forget to stop to question what we are putting in & end up settling with whatever the output. Why are we keeping in those nuts that are way too far gone to call a ‘deep roast’ & are actually sitting there, bitter & stale confusing the flavours we actually like & work for *us*. Why aren’t we spending more time on getting the consistency correct if smooth is what we personally like? Yeah, you get to the crunchy faster, but what’s the point if that’s not what *you* like. I was going to de-nut-afy everything I just typed but I shan’t. I’m going to leave it here. Actually that’s outrageous. Fine...
Ps. Don’t forget to check in with yourself & question things. All the things. Your mood. Your crowd. Your thoughts. Goals. Passions. Things that piss you off. Everything, don’t keep things bottled up.....(in a jar?)

Again, I’m sure everybody has now read a million captions/ heard a million stories today saying ‘don’t feel pressured to go back/ do what others are doing’ but let me just repeat it one last time for that person in the back. How you train, how you choose to move your body is entirely up to you. Whatever YOU enjoy, do exactly that. If that means you’ll never step foot in a gym, fab. If it means you’ll never run, great. Focus on what gets you hyped because that is the key to consistency. For sure you can mimic others but what the heck is the point if it’s not bringing you any happiness! Anyway. I’m mid picking up toppings for homemade pizzas so imma leave it here. Sending love & good vibes your way & I hope you’ve all had a fab Monday however YOU have chosen to spend it!!!! xxxxxxxxx
Ps. Again. Move at your own pace. 💜

I believed it.⁣
I said it. ⁣
I did it.⁣
⁣
When I was slipping into my disordered relationship with exercise this is the kind of quote that re-enforced the guilt I had for rest days and the belief I had that what I was doing was really good for me. ⁣
I was just being healthy.⁣
I was just being dedicated. ⁣
⁣
But when those workouts cause injury, pro-long illness and cause anxiety around rest days...are they healthy? Are they the best thing for you? ⁣
⁣
Probably not. ⁣
⁣
So whilst on the surface this may seem a harmless fitspo phrase, I needed to unpack this and explain why it’s subtle message to always override your bodies cues to exercise isn’t helpful. ⁣
⁣
In extreme cases it’s harmful. ⁣
⁣
ALWAYS trust your body, listen to it, and work with it. ⁣

Where the actual fuck did this come from?

I will tell you where, some people create this straw man argument that talking about calorie balance means you disregard everything else. It is dumb.

I have been accused of “ignoring food quality” despite the fact that I frequently tell people that prioritising unprocessed and nutrient-dense foods is a good idea, if they have the ability to do so.

I have been accused of “ignoring hormones” despite discussing various hormones at length, like leptin (my refeed and diet break video), testosterone (video on anabolic steroids) or insulin (low-carb videos).

Saying “you lose weight if you are in a calorie deficit” is not the same fucking thing as pretending that nothing else matters.

I am surprised I need to explain this lol.

Cheers to those people who are willing to dare to achieve something they've dreamt about. No matter how hard it gets, trust in yourself that if you give it everything you've got, you'll provide yourself that opportunity to shock even yourself!

After months of being away, this is possibly the biggest international chest day ever. Queues to the bench press that rival those of even the most popular theme parks.

Some tips for getting back into the gym:
- If you start slow it is easy to ramp up the individual workout volume. If you only perform a fraction of what you used to and feel fine in the following days, you have a foundation you can build on. If you do too much and are too sore to easily brush your hair or sit down for a shit, you have self sabotaged the next few days of exercise.
- You don’t even have to do the same workout split. A few fully body sessions to ease in may be more beneficial than going straight into a massive chest or leg day.
- Higher reps are legit. If you are out of practice on an exercise, you may feel like you need to relearn the movement again. If you haven’t played golf for a few months your swing might feel a little rusty, likewise if you go straight into heavy bench, you may shake like an electric toothbrush.
- You will be weaker, which is normal. When I was first ill and off the gym for months I went from a 500lb deadlift to not being able to lift a 25lb bar from the floor. Feeling weaker can suck, try and lean into it and embrace it. Making yourself feel shit probably won’t help anything.
- Making progress hinges on psychology. If there is something you can do that makes exercise more fun, do it. Lifting with friends can help if you are a social butterfly, or when the gym is quiet if that’s your thing. Recording your workouts so you can see when you are making progress can be helpful for some people. Give yourself leeway on exercise selection so you aren’t trying to follow a plan you hate. In the same way that good dietary habits you adopt consistently will beat great ones that you do inconsistently, adherence is always going to be a bottleneck for everyone apart from the super hardcore exercise enthusiasts who wouldn’t even miss a workout if the apocalypse was coming that day.
- If soreness was a reliable indicator of muscle growth, running a marathon would be anabolic as fuck. Chase progress, not soreness.","Ben Carpenter @bdccarpenter Ifa a gym bro has been out of the gym for months, IS finally allowed to train again and can pick any workout for their first session back... ...how many warm up sets do they take before they attempt a one rep max bench press?",,,2.82,2.82,1.06

It’s possible that some of us are born a little bit more talented or gifted with specific things, it’s the luck of the draw really but this doesn’t mean you can’t be as good, just means you may have to work harder or smarter. 

The issue is people spend so much energy telling their friends or themselves about why they can’t instead of spending energy trying to figure it out and the truth is you do that because it makes you feel better about yourself #excuses😅

Wether you’re born into some level of privilege or not as long as you’re breathing anything IS ACHIEVABLE it’s just a matter of taking action on a daily basis instead of talking about why you can’t. 

This applies to anything you’re doing fitness, business and even friendship.

Taken from #TheArtOfResilience (see link in bio for your copy) “Strength underpins everything we do and it is the accumulation of strength over a period of time that allows all of our body’s structures to adapt and make us less prone to injury and more able to deal with the stresses and strains that we place upon it. Whether that be bones, muscles, joints, ligaments or tendons. All of these structures have the ability to adapt to the forces that are placed upon them. If we load too quickly we get injured - that load could come in many forms but in simple terms if we have not accustomed our body and its structures to the loads that we intend to place on it then we will almost certainly pick up some form of injury. On the other hand, if we increase the load gradually over time and expose our body and its structures to ever increasing loads while incorporating some rest and recovery time (that allows the body to adapt further) then we become stronger and more resilient” #Gymshark 🔱",,,,2.72,2.72,-1.06

We see what we consider “natural” abilities in comedians for being so funny, but we ignore the hundreds of shows memorising the same order of jokes for years.

I was flattered to be called “a natural speaker” but I’m not. I’m just not afraid to get on stage and because of that I’ve become an experienced speaker, not a natural. 

We have a human tendency to connect people’s dots for them as to how they are doing so well, I’m here to remind you that more often than not it’s usually quite simply repetition. 

I’ve come to realise that life isn’t always easy and you’re often faced with two directions in which to go: 

- become more competent, adapt, overcome, grow, be audacious and better your knowledge and abilities however you can. 

- or to complain, those of you that complain are merely doing so because you’re not competent enough yet and you’d rather whinge and moan than face the daunting task of having to develop yourself. 

It’s the world’s fault, you shouldn’t have to change for it, right?

The truth is; complaining doesn’t often ever change anything in life. It rarely works. 

So realise you have the same opportunity as anyone else when it comes to talent, if they’re better than you they’ve probably repeated it more than you have. That’s it. 

Do whatever you can to become more competent over time, hit your reps, even the ugly ones, then one day you may hear someone say you’re “a natural talent.”

Mad that.",THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NATURAL TALENT. WE'RE ALL BORN WITH ZERO ABILITIES. YOU EITHER BECOME COMPETENT OR YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE COMPLAINING INSTEAD. Jam Smith James,,,2.72,2.72,1.31

Went for a walk earlier today, got completely and utterlyyyy drenched. Cursed in my head. Was raging inside at the timing of the rain/ decision to walk. Socks wet, feet wet, trackies, everything. Upon my moping back home I passed an elderly couple & I smiled at them. Their faces immediately lit up and they both smiled right back at me. I kept waking back (as if I’d just come out the shower) but it shifted my mood. And instead I spent the remainder of my walk back thinking about all the things I’m grateful for. You guys were one of them. Just so you know xxx anyway, I know it sounds cheesy and I say it countless times but I firmly believe that the energy you give out to the world is what you get back/ attract. So a reminder to choose a smile over a frown. A push to opt for the half full glass over the half empty. And a final pushy reminder to spread peanut butter over marmite. I mean, love over hate**** 🤣😅. (Is it overkill if I know push you all to hit the thumbs up on the YouTube video rather than the dislike button???? LMAO).

Some shocked, others relieved! 
.
So many women STILL do not realise that social media is only a snippet of someone’s reality. A split second glance into their life that they choose for you to see. 
I feel so passionate about speaking out and showing others that you can still be healthy, strong and fit even with characteristics that you or others call flaws. 
It’s no wonder women or younger girls feel insecure about their appearances when 90% of what they see on here are perfectly posed bodies with the best angles, lighting and editing. 
.
So here’s me at a photoshoot. One of me showing off my physique with tensed muscles and a top fitness photographer snapping away. The other of me standing how I would normally, relaxed and thinking about the massive burger I was getting afterwards!
.
Of course, I love to flex, I love to show off my muscle I’ve worked SO damn hard for, I love to look glamorous and feel sexy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
BUT,
We also all need to recognise that our bodies will not always look like this and THAT IS NORMAL! You should never feel ashamed or be embarrassed. 
Cellulite, stretch marks, skin folds, wrinkles, spots... you name it. Most of us have it. Me included! 
.
So please, remember this the next time you feel down about your body. YOU ARE A QUEEN 👑
You’re beautiful inside and out! 
You’re unique and YOU ARE YOU! 
Be kind to yourself always.

2015 was the height of my Powerlifting career.

Everything I did was focused on improving my strength, performance & physique.
.
My training was on point. My nutrition was dialed. My sleep was incredible.
.
My life was structured around my fitness. It was not balanced. It was not a lifestyle. It was a mission.
.
Fast forward to 2018 and I was in the middle of my 3-year deal coaching @garyvee 7x/week for 3 years straight.
.
My focus shifted from my fitness to my business.
.
I ate like shit. I barely worked out. I hardly slept. I was traveling all over the world and spent more time in airports & hotels than I did in my own apartment.
.
I don’t regret it. It changed my life for the better. But it was not balanced. It was not healthy. It was a mission.
.
Fast forward another 3 years to 2021 and my health and fitness are arguably the best they’ve ever been.

I’m no where near breaking any powerlifting records. And I certainly don’t have the most successful business in the world.

Most important, even though I took, literally, 3 years away from focusing on my own health & fitness...
.
Even though I pulled all nighters every week...
.
Even though my nutrition and training went to shit for 3 years straight...
.
I didn’t “ruin” my progress.
.
I didn’t fuck anything up.
.
Because when I was finally ready to get back to focusing on myself...I just started.
.
I didn’t dwell on what I did wrong.
.
I focused on what I could now do right.
.
Same goes for you.
.
Quit focusing on the past. Stop worrying about what’s already been done.
.
Focus on now.
.
Focus on what you can do...what you can control...what actions you can take.
.
And do it.
.
Now.
.
Don’t wait.
.
And don’t quit.
.
Because you will never fail as long you don’t give up.

It legit takes me 45mins plus between deciding I’m heading out to actually being on the bike. ⁣
I need to get slicker at getting all the bits and bobs together and getting all the gear on lol.⁣

Don’t be scared to ask for help 

Don’t be scared to step outside your comfort zone

Don’t be scared be shit at something new, the magic happens outside of your comfort zone

It only happens if you take action, nothing is handed to you 

You’re never to big time to not get help or advice from others, you learn from each other and with great friendships you can accomplish great things.

Forever grateful for everyone that supports the journey too ❤️✊🏼

Paige claims a session of cryotherapy burns 300-700 calories 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼

I would tag her but I’m blocked 😑. In a recent post, Paige claimed that 2-3 minutes of cryotherapy could burn up to 300-700 kcal! Swipe right to see claim 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼

When people rightly called her on this absolute horseshit, she back tracked & claimed that this was over a 24 hour period of time due increased metabolic rate over that period from the cryotherapy (I believe she is a paid affiliate or has a financial stake in this business, someone please correct me if I’m mistaken).

How does her claim stack up to the scientific literature? Let’s have a look shall we? 😬

Lubkowska et al 2015 investigated the effect of several months of daily cryotherapy (3 min at -130 C) sessions combined with exercise on body weight, fat mass, & blood lipids. At the end of the experiment there was no difference in fat mass or body weight 🤷🏼‍♂️

In a shorter, more tightly controlled study, 12 pro tennis players received 2x per day cryotherapy for 3 min at -120 C for 5 days. The researchers saw NO DIFFERENCE in metabolic rate at any time point & no difference in amount of fat used as a metabolic substrate. A similar experiment in physically active men also saw the  same results, no increase in metabolic rate (Ziemann 2012, 2014) 🤷🏼‍♂️

A recent review of the literature concluded that cryotherapy “Does not affect the resting metabolic rate or energy expenditure during exercise.” (Lombardi et al 2017)

Sorry Paige, as per usual, you have no evidence to support your claim, instead you continue to peddle ‘hacks’ and ‘tricks’ to your audience, since REAL evidence based fitness advice isn’t sexy enough.

What’s even more disappointing is I previously spoke with her regarding her claims & even offered to help her if she had questions, that she could ask me before posting to make sure she didn’t make false claims. She never took me up on that offer

Fitness influencers beware, the days of being able to claim whatever you want without evidence are over. It will no longer be tolerate 🔥",,,,2.39,2.39,1.94

I am what I do. I live and breathe TRX so when I'm not training on the straps, I'm filming people on the straps or writing about the straps for a magazine or teaching TRX LIVE. I dream about TRX most nights. 

I've chased what I'm doing right now ever since I started PT and you know what's got me to this point? Totally selfish, unstoppable, laser focus.

Even if I'm not actually the best TRX'r on the planet, no one person can convince me otherwise. I just won't have it. I believe in myself that much and so far it's worked. 

8 hours a day average, 5 days a week, 260 days a year for 12 years. I'm closing in on 25,000 hours of working on my craft.

Point of this? Find your passion, don't let people dissuade you, believe in yourself even when you fail miserably and never ever stop working for what you want. Just don't. It'll work, I promise. 

If it doesn't. Bill me.

On the dullest of days, it’s moody, intense, dramatic and stunning. And then when the sun comes out, it’s fresh, bursting with colour, almost exotic and it literally sparkles.

Nature definitely suits me. 💁🏼‍♀️🌱🌞 Yet I so clearly remember hiking with my family in Yorkshire when we were kids, moaning about all the cow pat, the rain, the cold... basically moaning about everything. 😂 I remember saying to my uncle that I’ll never live anywhere out of the city because “I’m a city girl” LOL 15 year old Cat was such a classy city lass... even though she’d never even lived in a city at that point! 😂

Fast forward to now and I’m so far from being a “city girl”. The city and I get along for approximately 24hrs and then I need to escape to nature. Give me the countryside, the coast, the forest. Anything green and blue where the air is fresh. It’s not for everyone, but like I said, nature suits me, it’s where I feel most at home.

Where do you feel most at home? Are you currently trying to decide between the city and countryside/coast?

1. Train in a way you enjoy = enjoyment = consistency
2. Push yourself. (Not by punishing or battering your body into doing something where the thought alone  makes you want to cry). Push yourself however you fancy. Challenge yourself by doing something new, do more reps, complete a circuit faster, increase the weight, push the distance.. whatever you choose, remember you are competing against no one but yourself. 
3. Let your body recover (that way you don’t half ass sessions the next day cos you ache so much you are woddling like a duck & can barely bend down to pick up a weight)
4. When the idea of training bores you, switch things up. Training should never feel like a chore.
5. Listen to no one & nothing that involves the words ‘quick fix’ - just no.
6. Learn to pose/ flex as if your life depended on it/ position camera correctly/ get decent lighting = adds significant gains tbf👌

⁣
Some groups of people say that alcohol has absolutely no place in the pursuit to gain muscle or lose fat. Other groups say that alcohol is incredibly good for you and is a must for improving cardiovascular health and inflammation… so which is right? 🤨⁣
⁣
Lets answer by discussing alcohol’s effect on weight loss, weight gain, energy intake and muscle 👇⁣
⁣
Weight Loss: Fletchner-Mors et al. (2004) placed two groups on a 1,500kcal weight loss diet. One group got 10% of calories from white wine and the other group got 10% of calories from grape juice. Subjects on both groups had similar weight decreases and similar decreases in body fat %, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol 🍾⁣
⁣
Weight Gain: A study by Cordain et al. (1997) placed participants in a 20-week cross-over trial. In one 10-week period, participants consumed 190ml of wine per day on 5 days per week. In the other 10-week period, participants did not consume alcohol. Calories were maintained the same in both parts of the trial. No weight changes were observed when participants consumed alcohol compared to when they remained abstinent. 🍷⁣
⁣
Calorie Intake: Caton et al. (2004) compared energy intake and hunger after 0, 1 and 4 units of alcohol. It was found that 4 units of alcohol increased energy intake and subjective hunger but 0 and 1 did not - showing there is a threshold where alcohol can increase appetite and food intake 🍔🍟⁣
⁣
Muscle: High intakes of alcohol can actually reduce muscle protein synthesis for a period of 12 hours. Specifically, it can blunt contraction-induced changes, which are the ones that we chase after in the gym (Steiner & Lang, 2014) 🤭⁣
⁣
Overall: Alcohol won’t cause you to gain weight or interfere with weight loss as long as calories are in check. If you decide to have multiple drinks, it may increase appetite and affect muscle protein synthesis. Thus, the most important thing about consuming alcohol is doing it in moderation. 1-2 drinks will be fine for most people but more may lead to the unwanted effects ⭐️⁣

We focus on the wrong things and when our focus is purely to make an area thinner or to look a specific way you’re going to struggle to ever be fully satisfied with yourself. 

Why can’t we focus on 

1. Being stronger 
2. Building muscle 
3. Being robust for a specific activity 
4. Being able to do a pull up 

If we have a focus that has a performance aspect we can remove the mentality of “thinner legs” “ thinner arms” and all the other things that doesn’t matter. 

Focus on something that will actually make you feel amazing 

Stop questioning how you look everyday when you wake up and look in the mirror, stop checking to see if your leg is a little thinner than the day before, it does nothing...

It stresses me out even thinking about waking up and checking that shit 😩

This adds zero value to your life, focus on getting your legs and body being stronger instead

Let’s change the way we think about things that don’t  matter and remove the people that see that as value too. 

Ps: thickness is cool, thickness is sexy and powerful, relax your batty 🍑

I felt like a fraud this morning. My inner dialogue was running riot, telling me that I can’t be a good movement and meditation guide because I haven’t taken enough time for my personal practice over the last two weeks. Things have been busy which is fine, but I know it’s more than that. I was avoiding my practices. It felt pretty shitty. I got frustrated with myself, started to look at my body (always my personal go-to for self sabotage), taking out my sadness on my reflection, having moments where I thought I should quit what I love, feeling myself get deeper into this hole of not being enough.

I sat with it for about an hour and then decided to do something about it. I journaled the feelings, asked myself some pretty deep questions. I then got annoyed that I avoided the journaling mid-way through and found myself scrolling Instagram for 20 minutes. Sat with that frustration. Said out loud to myself “Compassion. Remember compassion.” And so I did. I came back to my journal, with a softer approach. I made a very small list of short term goals. To consciously breathe for 10 minutes, to move on my mat for 20-minutes, to dance to some of my favourites songs and to go for a walk on my own.

I have now ticked all of those things of my list and I feel so much better. I’m not saying that these doubts and these anxieties won’t come up again and that everything is solved, but sometimes all it takes are some baby steps, awareness, compassion and space.

I think it’s easy to look at social media and see someone with X number of followers and a successful business and assume they’ve got it all together. I think I speak for many business women out there when I say that we are only human. I know so many of you reading this no matter what industry you’re in, will have had thoughts like this. My advice to you always is to come back to compassion and use the tools that you’re familiar with to help cultivate a sense of calm in your soul. From there, you can unpack, unwind, go inwards, ask for space, ask for support, make goals. But mindfully.

Weight loss as a process looks very simple on paper, “eat less, move more” and from a thermodynamic perspective, that is basically all there is to it.

A perhaps unfortunate byproduct of this is that because it looks simple on paper, a lot of people don’t realise the complexities involved. As such, we discuss people changing their body weight as a very straightforward “choice”, someone can choose to change their body weight or not, right?

But, by painting it as a very simple “choice” we run the risk of overlooking a metric fuckload of reasons why changing your body weight is much harder for some people than it is for others.

Let’s discuss some of them.

⁣
My workouts took hours... Or they didn’t count. I thought MORE was BETTER.⁣
⁣
I thought eating fewer and fewer calories would help me reach my goal... Until I didn’t recognize myself.⁣
⁣
I cut out foods that I thought were “bad” until I didn’t have many options left to eat... And then spun even more out of control. ⁣
⁣
If I was tired, sore, injured, or hungry... It didn’t matter. I ignored the signs my body was giving me. ⁣
⁣
My body physically was shutting down, but my mind still thought, “Smaller. Smaller. Smaller.”⁣
⁣
Doctors. Treatment. Therapy. Practice. Grace.⁣
⁣
Over a decade later, I am a new person. ⁣
⁣
One big lesson learned is to shift the focus to building STRENGTH in workouts instead of working out to get smaller.⁣
⁣
The irony here is that a byproduct of strength training is all the things people typically are working out for... Muscle tone, fat loss, etc. but the shift to strength is transformational for both the body AND mind.⁣
⁣
💛Building strength allows you to accomplish things you never thought you could do. You not only can change how you look, but you gain confidence and are empowered by your body’s abilities.⁣
⁣
💡Shift your focus from trying to get smaller to building strength. It becomes about you getting to add to your life vs. what you have to take away.⁣
⁣
💛Let’s get STRONG.⁣

I have said multiple times that there was no evidence that exogenous ketones would help fat loss in humans. Maybe they are better for appetite regulation (than a dextrose drink lol) and maybe ketogenic diets are good for appetite regulation (in some people, by no means are they the ""best"") but this should not be confused with *adding* exogenous ketones on top of your diet.

Well, as of yesterday there is a brand new paper that concluded ketone supplements did not alter body composition.

Three groups. 1) Ketogenic diet + placebo 2) ketogenic diet + ketones 3) low fat diet.

Yes, both ketogenic diets were low carb (<40g per day) and yes, they raised ketone levels (>1.0 mM capillary BHB).

No differences in body composition after six weeks but there was a trend for less nitrogen loss in the ketone supplement group which *maybe* might help retain more lean body mass over a longer period of time.

I like stacking the odds in my favour even more than your average obsessive gym bro but you know what, for the cost I think I am going to give that one a miss on the off chance it might maybe help out a little bit in the future.

And once again, when calories are controlled and protein is controlled, changing the ratio of carbs and fat in your diet appears to make very little difference to changes in body fat.

The authors conclude: ""... short-term changes in body composition during caloric restriction are driven by caloric restriction more so than level of ketosis or macronutrient distribution.”

Just keep in mind that staying consistent with the basic, foundational movements will help you continually get stronger and consistent results.⁣

One way I like to keep it interesting and also keep progressing is through different variations of the foundational exercises.⁣

Here are a few ideas for how you can make the same exercise a little bit different: 😊⁣
⁣
✔️Equipment: barbell, dumbbell, kettlebell, band⁣
✔️Stance: bilateral (both legs), staggered stance, unilateral (single leg)⁣
✔️Programming: sets, rep range, tempo⁣

But for some reason, I am yet to receive any cheques from Big Haribo, which is very disappointing.

I am not ""pro-sugar"", I am just trying to bust some misinformation that causes people to have really unnecessary food paranoia.

Is ""sugar"" easy to overeat? Well, yes and no.

On it's own, it is sweet but when it isn't combined with any other flavours or ingredients, isn't actually very exciting. Not many people motorboat the bag of sugar they readily keep in their kitchen or drink maple syrup from the bottle.

But, it is often included in foods that are easy to overeat. When you think of ""addictive"" foods, it often appears, because the most ""addictive"" foods are highly processed and multi-ingredient.

But, unprocessed foods high in sugar, like fruits aren't normally considered addictive, right?

Also, some highly processed foods that we do consider addictive are low in sugar, but high in fat and salt like chips/crisps and fries/chips.

My biggest concern over demonising ""sugar"" without any further context is because there is an abundance of people who are paranoid of eating fruit, because they view it as ""sugar"".

If your criticism of food starts and stops with ""sugar"", foods like fruits which are higher in micronutrients, harder to overeat, rarely considered ""addictive"" and actually associated with *lower* body weights in observational research are tarnished with the same brush as ultra-processed, hyperpalatable, calorie dense, micronutrient sparse foods, and that is dumb.

There are very real conversations to be had about the amount of added sugars people consume, but there are also very real conversations to be had about how heavily we scrutinise sugar in isolation. People often look at things through a straw, they see a little piece of the puzzle but bigger picture.

It felt as if Murphy’s law was in the works-everything that could go wrong did. My daughter has had a high fever for a couple of days now. We had an accident last night in the bed. My dog pooped in the house because it was raining. I spent 15 minutes looking for my son’s school shoes only to find them outside by the trampoline, soaking in the rain. Then I went to make my coffee and forgot to place my cup under the machine which lead to coffee seeping into all of my drawers.

I paused what I was doing, quietly went into my bedroom, sat on the bed, cried, and prayed. Being a single mama is tough. Especially when you don’t have family or a current significant other to help most days. I never knew it would be like this. But a little voice said, “mama, I’ll help you.” My daughter snuck into my room when she noticed I had walked away for a bit. I hugged and held her tight. That moment right then and there instantly made my morning better. God answered my prayer of needing a little motivation to get me through my morning.

I know this isnt my typical fitness post. But I know a lot of you are going through what I’m going through right now. I want to remind &  encourage you that it’s okay to pause and cry. Motherhood is hard enough. But single motherhood? The hardest. But also the most rewarding.

So I wiped my tears, walked strongly back into the kitchen with a towel and cleaned up the coffee with dignity and a smile. There’s no use in crying over spilled coffee! 🙂

I hope everyone has a wonderful day today. No matter how it started. Your attitude can greatly change the rest of your day if you allow it. 🖤",,,,2.11,2.11,4.68

Ok, we eat a protein rich meal, what happens? Groen et al., demonstrated that after consuming 20g of protein, 40-50% of that protein is “first-pass cleared,” meaning that it’s used up by the gut & liver for local metabolism & protein synthesis & the other 50% made it into circulation. Only 11% of the total 20g protein bolus was used for muscle protein synthesis (MPS). That means that only a small percentage of what is consumed is actually used for building muscle💪🏻

So how much do we need per meal?
Well, this depends on age. Older adults develop “anabolic resistance” which means that its hard to turn on anabolic processes. Thus, older adults require more protein than younger adults to maximally stimulate MPS. Stokes et al., found that young adults (22 years) can maximize MPS with 0.24 g per kg of bodyweight in a single meal whereas that number is much higher for older adults (0.60 g/kg BW). Of course, these numbers are dependent on protein quality. Protein sources with more leucine (animal proteins like whey & egg) require less protein to maximize MPS whereas lower quality sources of protein like wheat (low in leucine) require quite a bit more total protein

These data are in resting adults though. Data from Witard et al., suggest that following exercise 40g has significant benefits over 20g.
I often hear people mention that “you can only absorb or digest about 30g of protein per meal,” but is simply not true. You absorb almost all of it, but only a small amount goes to MPS, but in order to maximize MPS it requires a DISPROPORTIONATE amount of protein compared to what is incorporated into muscle. Thus, consuming 30-40g of protein per meal every 3-5 hours should maximize MPS & muscle growth 💪🏻

Important to note that this data does not consider the effects on muscle protein breakdown (MPB) which could change things. However, due to methodological challenges in assessing MPB, relatively little is known about it. Still, the consensus of experts is that changes in MPB contribute little compared to MPS for facilitating changes in long term muscle mass

I could go on and on about how unhelpful labels like ’healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ can be if you’re feeling pretty weird about food.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
I’ll try not to.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
But !!!!! I always find this logic here helps in the early stages of letting them go. Which is that our diets and eating habits aren’t the sum of one single food we ate on a sunny Monday afternoon at 5:05 pm.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
It’s the sum of *all* foods we enjoy within the context of a day, week, month, and year.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Branding single foods as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ strips they away from all context and judges foods in isolation.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
Which is kinda pointless. As we don’t eat one individual food in isolation forever. We eat a whole variety :)))⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
We don’t expect each individual food to give us *everything* we need by themselves.
We don’t shit on apples for not having any protein and label them as ‘bad!!!!!’.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
So avoid shitting on chocolate and other less-nutrient dense things you wanna put in your mouth.⠀
⁠⠀⁠⠀
They taste pretty fucking great - and food that tastes great is a major contribution to our mental health. That adds a lovely and essential element to our diets. I’d say that’s pretty ‘healthy’ if you asked me 🤝🤝🤝🤝",'unhealthy' 'healthy' our diet can't be described by one food in isolation it's made up of all foods we enjoy in context of eachother,,,2.06,2.06,-1.16

I’ve never been a fan of dedicated core training. It’s not that I don’t think it’s valuable (although you are using your core a whole lot in compound and unilateral movements), it’s that I don’t really enjoy it and when I plan to tack it onto the end of my strength training days, I end up skipping it most times 😬.

As I’ve moved to a 3-day strength program (my own Building Blocks program 💁🏼‍♀️) I’ve been incorporating specific core work on 1-2 other days. Since I’m postpartum and still rebuilding my core strength, I know I need to dedicate more time to it than I used to (and prefer to 😝). It’s easy to find effective body weight core exercises that you can scale to increase or decrease the difficulty and they take less time than a full body workout so they’re more doable at home.

🔸Pike-ups to push-up with socks or sliders (push-up optional)
🔸Drop-set: bent legs
🔹Lateral pull-throughs from bear
🔸Rotating side plank (elevated optional)
🔸Superset: side plank pulses (elevated optional)
🔹Reptiles (feet elevated optional)
🔹Superset: Knees come forward
🔸Pallof press with small plate on the band (plate very optional)

The 🐻 pull-throughs are a staple exercise I’ve been using. You can increase or decrease the challenge to resist rotation when you pull the weight by using a heavier or lighter weight and placing it on something that offers more or less resistance when you pull. I’m using a 40 lb kettlebell and a small towel. You don’t *need* anything underneath but I like the floors less scratched and scuffed 😝.

I’ve modified the side plank exercises to make them elevated as they’re slightly easier this way and this is where my strength is at right now where I feel like I can control my core throughout the exercise but am still challenged. You can easily move to the floor if you want to make it harder.

The last one I got from my dear brother who uses it in his boxing training. Pallof presses are a great exercise without it but it’s a good way to increase the instability and make it more challenging.

Which is your favourite to train?
.
Whether you’re a booty babe, quad queen or both, these exercise videos will help you understand the engagement in the muscles you want to target. You will of course work your glutes, quads & hamstrings but with slight differences in movement, foot placement or stance... you can put more emphasis onto a particular muscle.
.
1️⃣ BACK & FRONT SQUATS 
To hit your quads more you want to have your feet pointing forwards with a closer stance. Adding heel elevation will increase range of motion and squat depth. 
Squatting with a wider stance and toes pointing outwards will put more emphasis on the glutes. Add a resistance band to further activate the muscles.
.
2️⃣ KNEELING SQUATS 
To target the glutes more with this movement you will need to hinge more at the hips and activate your glutes with each rep. With the increased bend at the knee, the hamstrings don’t work as hard and therefore the glutes take over.
With your knees narrower together and a greater bend at the knees, you will use your quads more. Notice how I lean back into the squat with no hip hinge.
.
3️⃣ FORWARD & REVERSE LUNGES
Forward lunges are a more challenging exercise, placing more emphasis on your quads due to the forward movement. Reverse lunges are easier to balance and better for your knees. They also activate the glutes more. 
.
4️⃣ BULGARIAN SPLIT SQUATS
To hit your quads more keep your front foot closer to the bench and use a slightly faster tempo keeping tension on the quad.
To hit the glutes more place your front foot further away from the bench and squeeze your glutes at the top of the rep with a slight pause.
.
Hope these tips were helpful! In my fitness programs I demonstrate the correct way to perform every exercise - It’s so important to get this right for maximum results!

.
First...way too many people do things that are drastic and/or completely unsustainable (think juice cleanses, detox’s, keto, etc). The reason they do them is because they want to lose as much weight as humanly possible in the least amount of time. Which always sounds great but inevitably leads to rapid weight regain (usually more than they lost in the first place).
.
Second...people expect the scale to go down every day. Even when they logically know it won’t go down every day (or even every week), they let their emotions get the best of them and convince themselves things aren’t working when the scale doesn’t keep dropping. Even worse when the scale randomly spikes up. And, again, even though they know the scale will spike up for any number of reasons far beyond fat gain, they still freak the fuck out and use that as a justification to quit.
.
Third...as soon as they have one “bad” meal or a “treat” or dessert or, God forbid, take a vacation and enjoy themselves for a week, they think they fucked everything up. They think they ruined all of their progress and use that as a justification to binge and quit and throw in the towel.
.
These are just 3 of many many many many reasons why people fail.
.
But suffice to say, the answer to remedy these issues are very simple.
.
1) Don’t do something drastic or completely unsustainable. If the methods are unsustainable, your results will be unsustainable. Do something you enjoy and can sustain long-term.
.
2) Quit living and dying by the fucking scale. It’s just data.
.
3) You can’t fuck this up unless you quit altogether. So stop being such a fucking asshole to yourself and get back on track.

While these exercises focus a lot on the glutes, they don’t work them exclusively. Don’t be afraid to train your quads and hammies; it’s important to build well-rounded strength 👊🏻.
-
🍑 Back extensions (regular and glute-focused) and Banded reverse hypers:
Man do I ever miss having a back extension machine 🙈. These are great. The glute-focused ones might seem strange or potentially injurious to get into this position but you’re not loading your spine, just increasing your glutes contribution and reducing your erector’s involvement.
.
These usually go right near the end of my workout and I’ll use light weight (e.g. 50 lb dumbbell) or often just bodyweight with reps 25-30.
.
The banded reverse hypers are quite the set-up (I was so impressed the hip pad worked on the box 😝) but I like them as a sub. You can also use a couch and anything heavy to pin the band down, or stick with frog reverse hypers
-
🍑Front foot elevated split squats OR Barbell split squats:
Because people always ask, the difference vs a lunge is that the legs are stationary in a split squat. I feel more stable in a split squat because balance is less of a limiting factor and can therefore comfortably use more weight and execute with a little more control (which is great for muscle growth).
.
I prefer to take a wide stance and lean my torso forward to make it a little more hip dominant (less quad-focused) but both variations will work your glutes well.
.
I generally use reps in the 8-12 range with a relatively heavy (it’s always relative) weight.
-
🍑Single leg hip thrusts or Barbell hip thrusts:
These have a shorter range of motion than most exercises that work your glutes but they target them very effectively. This also means you can use a considerable amount of weight and get very strong with this exercise 💪🏻. Don’t underestimate single leg thrusts; even unweighted they’re challenging!
.
Make sure you’re getting to FULL hip extension (don’t sacrifice form for increased weight).

I get messaged on insta or WhatsApp from mates asking if I purely train on TRX to build muscle. It's as if because there's zero steel or iron involved that it's almost incomprehensible.

The answer is 80% TRX, 15% Kettlebells, 5% Resistance Bands

The proof? It's all we have here at the TRX Studios, and it was the same at the last studio we operated at, and has my muscle mass decreased since COVID? It's increased. I train more.

You are what you regularly do. And thats the answer. Just train regularly and your body will adapt accordingly. 

If you run everyday, guess what? You're a runner and your body will make the adjustments you're asking of it. As long as you're not scoffing pizza everyday you'll lean up, your muscles will become smaller to accommodate the long distance demands and your heart and lungs will become stronger.

If you're a scaffolder and you lift 21ft poles everyday you're going to have strong arms, shoulders and core.

If you do yoga everyday you'll be extremely flexible with an affinity for pictures with sunsets behind you.

So if you TRX everyday, pushing, pulling, jumping, planking, twisting then your body will adapt to having a balanced strong phyqisue.

I adapt it and train slow tempo for time under tension and sometimes add Kettlebell supersets and resistance bands. Guess what? Gives me muscles.

So in answer to your question? Yes.

But thank you for asking.",,,,1.95,1.95,1.35

NO

Been getting this question a lot recently. I guess because I’m 39 years old. I want to be clear: if you are living a healthy lifestyle & your testosterone is low I have zero issue with you getting TRT so long as you don’t compete in a drug tested organization that bans TRT. Go for it

Let’s talk about why I am not on TRT. Simple answer is: I don’t need it. Every time I’ve ever had my testosterone checked (with the exception of contest prep) I’ve been between 800-1100 🤷🏼‍♂️. I don’t need it

I have SO MANY PEOPLE talk to me about this who have NEVER ever had their testosterone measured. They just hit age 30 & assume they need it 🙄. I’m gonna say it: you are just looking for excuses to get on the sauce 🤷🏼‍♂️

If you want to get on gear go for it, but don’t justify you ‘need it’ because your test is ‘low’ when you never actually bothered to measure it. Also many of these people eat like crap, don’t train consistently, & sleep like shit. Is your testosterone really low because you hit age 30? Or is it because your lifestyle sucks?

People look at my testosterone results & say ‘lucky.’ 😑. You know what increases testosterone? Lifting hard AF consistently. Not eating like crap. Getting enough sleep. Not abusing drugs & alcohol. Having a healthy sex life. SHOCKER 🙄

I resistance training consistently. I eat well consistently using our app @carbondietcoach to coach me (link in bio) & you can see the results for yourself. I don’t always get great sleep but I shoot for it & usually get at least 7 hours. I also don’t abuse drugs & alcohol. I won’t comment on my sex life but hey, you’ve seen my wife 🤷🏼‍♂️ #testbooster

Now, if you are doing all those things & still feel like shit & your test is low & you decide to use TRT more power to ya. But many of you just want an excuse to justify juicing. If you want to juice, then go for it, but stop trying to validate it with the fact that you are over 30 🙄

Further, I compete in @usapowerlifting which does not allow TRT & like I said, I don’t need it anyway. But more importantly, I PERSONALLY wouldn’t feel right selling you guys products when I’m on the juice 🤷🏼‍♂️",Ask me a question ÛuTRT? Are you on TRT?,,,1.93,1.93,1.15

Everyone who's ever lost weight and kept it off has had to make ""the switch.""

And if you want to get results that last, you will too.

The switch I'm referring to is a mental shift from seeing weight loss as a short-term fix to seeing it as the start of a new way of being.

Because regardless of how much weight you have to lose right now, you're going to be spending a far more significant percentage of your life maintaining those results. 

That's the goal, anyway.

And the only happen by making ""the switch.""

~

You know it too.

You know that you can't lose weight and go back to living the way you did before.

Yet still, you'll find yourself slipping into the trap of being allured by the newest & shiniest thing that promising ""fast"" results with zero regard to what happens once you reach your goal weight. 

(Cognitive dissonance at its finest.) 😉

But it's not your fault.

Most of what you've seen and heard about losing weight comes from marketers who are making riches from exploiting your pain.

They care more about your transaction than your transformation.

That’s why making ""the switch"" is freaking tough.

But you can make it easier by doing these two things:

1) Eliminating the ""due date"" you have for your goals.

2) Erasing pre-conceived beliefs and expectations you have about how quickly you should see results.

Your time-based expectations create unnecessary pressure.

And that unnecessary pressure pushes you towards unsustainable diets and exercise regimens.

It's also what makes you see slip-ups and mistakes as failures rather than opportunities to learn and grow.

When you don't have that unnecessary pressure, most of that goes away.

~

All that matters is that you keep showing up.

It might take you longer than you want.

It might even happen faster than you thought.

Either way, ""the switch"" will happen when you eliminate unnecessary pressure and put that energy into doing, learning, and growing into the best version of yourself.

– Carter","Whether you have 5, 10, 50, or 100 pounds to lose, assume it's going to take at least a year. This way, you're less focused on how quickly you lose weight and more focused on building sustainable habits. Carter Good @CarterGood LFL COACHING LINK IN BIO",,,1.9,1.9,1.6

Sorry Gary, you are clinging to the carbohydrate insulin model of obesity (CIM) which has been debunked

The CIM basically states that people don’t get obese from overeating, they get obese from high insulin, regardless of calories, & that insulin traps fat in fat cells, making the rest of the body sense that it is starving & people overeat in response⁣. He claims that anyone who loses fat MUST do so by restricting carbs. He even said he would REFUSE to change his mind even if his own studies he funded showed otherwise (swipe to last video to hear it from his mouth)
⁣⁣
How does the CIM stack up against the evidence? I went through a thorough debunking in my book Fat Loss Forever (link in bio). Here is the synopsis. We have over 30 studies that compare various levels of carb vs fat with calories & protein held constant. If the CIM was correct we’d expect to see greater fat loss & in low carb diets (LCD) when kcal/pro are equal, but we don’t. In fact the studies show a small advantage to low fat diets for fat loss (Hall & Guo). Even up to carb intakes of over 300g per day vs keto, there was no superiority for a LCD⁣
⁣⁣
2nd, the idea that insulin traps fat in fat cells thus we can’t lose fat? Nope, T2D & obese people have HIGHER blood FFAs, TAGs, & glucose. In a study where they gave a drug that inhibits lipolysis (acipimox) people lost just as much fat as those who weren’t on the drug & they didn’t increase their food intake (Makimura et al)⁣
⁣⁣
More damning, the trials of the drug liraglutide, which is a GLP-1 mimetic that increases insulin. People given this drug actually LOSE fat 🤣 (Pi-Sunyer et al). If insulin was the most important thing for fat loss, how could you elevate it compared to controls & lose MORE fat? Answer: because it’s not the most important thing
⁣
Others will cherry pick a study from Ludwig et al that found a 400+ kcal/d ⬆️ in EE on a LCD. But 1) the method they used to measure EE tends to overestimate EE on a LCD (Hall et al) & they failed to show changes in BMR or activity, so where is this ⬆️ in EE coming from? Magic? 🤨⁣
⁣⁣
LCD can be a good way to lose fat. But they are NOT superior for fat loss",,,,1.89,1.89,1.52

Lower body exercises to help you correct your form and make better progress 💪🏻
.
Never ever feel embarrassed if you have been performing any of these exercises incorrectly. I used too!!! And I’m not ashamed because it made me more determined to get it right. Remember failure is not the opposite of success, it’s part of success 🙌🏻
.
1️⃣ STRAIGHT LEG DEADLIFT 
This exercise can often get confused with a Romanian Deadlift where you purposely bend at the knees. Engage your lats and core before lowering the dumbbells down as far as you can until you feel the full stretch in your hamstrings. If you struggle to feel the engagement in your hamstrings, elevate your toes using plates which will give you a greater stretch.
.
2️⃣ GLUTE BRIDGE 
If your lower legs are too far forwards you will have less ROM (range of motion) and you will feel your hamstrings take over. To make the best out of this exercise it is so important to pause the rep and squeeze your glutes really hard whilst it is under tension. 
.
3️⃣ SIDE LUNGE 
When leaning forwards you are making the exercise easier by distributing your weight away from your lunging leg. Stand tall, engage your lats and keep looking forwards. This will really help you to keep good form throughout the exercise. Remember to always push through your heels to better activate your glutes. 
.
4️⃣ CABLE SIDE KICK 
If you are using your body for momentum then you are using a weight that is too heavy for you and as a consequence you are likely not working the correct muscles. Your leg should be the only body part moving in this exercise. 
.
Form should always come first 👌🏻

I feel like it has been a long while since I’ve posted an exclusively upper body workout, so here’s one 😝!

I’ve been doing full-body workouts for a while now, which is a great way to train especially when you have a 3 day training frequency, but lower/upper splits are still my favourite. When I have dedicated upper body days I have a more push-heavy day and a more pull-heavy day.

This one uses bands and dumbbells so hopefully it’s doable for most at home who have some equipment 👊🏻

🔹Z-presses
🔹Drop-set: baby presses (very optional. She was smiling at me and I couldn’t resist)
🔹Push-ups (harder mod: weighted, easier mod: incline)
🔹Inverted rows
🔹Banded lat pulldowns
🔹ss banded tricep extensions
🔹Lateral raises
🔹ss bent-over rear delt raises
🔸I did 3-4 sets and kept reps between 10-15 (went within 1-2 reps of failure for most).

I’m incorporating the z-presses to not only work on overhead pressing strength but to simultaneously challenge my core. This exercise is naaat easy for your core and I’m still working on rebuilding and wanted the core challenge (and hopefully ending up stronger than before 👊🏻). If you don’t have the requisite shoulder or hamstring mobility to do this exercise and press directly overhead while seated up straight, elevate your butt or choose a seated variation.

For the inverted rows, you can use TRX straps, a very sturdy scarf in a door (pleeeaaassee make sure this is actually sturdy before you fall backwards), a very sturdy table (same note as the previous one), a power tower, EQ bars, bars at a park, or even a helpful human 😆. Back training is often neglected when training at home because it’s harder to do without weights and machines than pushing exercises are but it’s super important to incorporate. Do your pulls!

Happy Friday everyone! ☀️

This is my 3rd week reverse dieting with our app @carbondietcoach (link in bio) after being at maintenance for 5 months post cut. I ended my maintenance phase around 3350 kcal/d & after 3 weeks of reversing the app has me up over 200 calories & I gotta say based on the previous weeks, I’m actually looking leaner 😬

How could this happen? Am I violating the laws of thermodynamics? Of course not. So what could explain me increasing my calories by over 200 but not gaining weight & actually looking slightly leaner? First thing is that by increasing my calories it’s possible I’m training harder & expending more calories during my sessions. I gotta say, I’ve been having some GREAT sessions. Further, we know that increasing calories can cause us to spontaneously move more without us realizing it, this increases our energy expenditure from non exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) which actually contributes quite a bit to our daily output. Finally, there is some evidence that increasing calories can also increase your basal metabolic rate (BMR)

That doesn’t mean you can pump up your calories & not expect to gain fat. In the case of reverse dieting, the idea is to slowly add them so that your adaptations for energy expenditure have a chance to keep pace with your increased energy intake. If I have in fact gotten leaner, which based on pictures, I think I have, then it means my energy expenditure is slightly outpacing my increase in calorie intake

Now this doesn’t happen forever, there will come a point at which I gain some body fat most likely. But I’m really enjoying this so far & looking forward to more calories & some crazy hard training

So every PT/influencer writes about this at some point or another and they're right to.

I am the worst for driving myself into the ground and not resting adequately. I get so much more done than others in short spaces of time but then pay the price sometimes physically and then mentally.

When you rest, you heal, you recover, you recuperate.

Eric Thomas says ""If you want to be successful, you gotta be willing to give up sleep. If you go to sleep, you might miss the opportunity to successful.”

I get the sentiment, he's talking about laziness and inactivity, but if you actually skip rest and sleep you're going to end up injured, stressed, and  operating on limited brain function. Success will just avoid you.

I find what really screws me up is the absolute inability to say no. Something I've written about it before. I let people access my time because I like to help but sometimes to the detriment of my own purpose. You end up getting to YOU last with little energy. It's tough to say no but when you're brave enough to do it, you get freedom.

It's a Bank Holiday today so I'll be relaxing and recovering so tomorrow I can fly all over again. What are YOU doing?

Lots of people claim to know what the “best” weight loss diet is.

What does the science actually say?

Let’s talk about:
- the differences between weight loss and fat loss
- the differences between short-term and long-term outcomes
- snail racing
- wankpuffins

This is from one of my soon-to-be-released plans and it’s a little bit “mean”, which is how I prefer my leg workouts 😝.

It’s important if you goal is to grow muscle, especially if you’re training at home and using less weight than you would in the gym, that you do your sets within a couple reps of failure. The last few reps should be slower and more challenging (but do your best to not let your form break). There’s nothing magical about 8-12 reps so if you’re approaching 12 reps for an exercise (and don’t have a heavier weight to use) and the reps are still looking as speedy as your first ones, do more reps to get closer to failure.

With that being said, no reps listed here. Go to where you’re challenged with the weights you have available. I did anywhere from 10-15 for most and then ~30 for the final superset.

🔸Banded lateral walks
🔸Bulgarian split squats
🔸Sumo squats
ss Kickstand RDLs
🔸Copenhagen plank
ss side lying hip raises
🔸Banded elevated glute bridges
ss Frog reverse hypers

Workshopping some new names for the banded lateral walks. I’m thinking “spare a square”? or “the roll is empty”. Maybe it’s just me who looks this ridiculous doing them.

If you haven’t tried Copenhagen planks, they are challenging. That’s the warning 😝. I’d suggest starting from your knee and if this is too easy, moving out so your foot is on the bench. You can also do lateral plate slides (put a plate on a towel and slide in from side to side) if you’d rather omit the Copenhagen planks.

Who is still training at home and who is back at the gym? Gyms in Toronto have been closed FOREVER now but it looks like many other places have opened back up. I’m not jealous, you’re jealous 😒😭

Taking some time out today. Trying to restore my mind and body. Though I have a good work/life balance in many ways, when things get busy I tend to go into overdrive and fight with a feeling of guilt if I rest. At this point my body is clever enough to send me some signs that will MAKE me rest, cue cluster headaches, skin break outs, achy muscles and weakness. That’s what I’m vibing with today, so right now I’m back in bed writing this caption and I’m about to turn my phone off and read my book.

So here’s your reminder to listen to your body when it sends you these signs. It’s more intelligent and intuitive than you give it credit for. And if possible, try to become more aware of these times so that you can rest BEFORE your body tells you to. Observe how you feel, notice if your workload (or any stress in your life) has picked up, prioritise your well-being. Saying no and putting in some healthy boundaries is key. 

Ultimately we can only give love, kindness, creativity and our energy if we ourselves are rested, revitalised and restored. ❤️

Repost from @o15nutrition

It’s not always about how heavy the weight is. Bodybuilding is about targeting select muscles and getting them to contract while negating momentum or letting more dominant muscles take over. 

Execution of an exercise is king 👑 

Check your ego and create a stronger mind-muscle connection next time you train.

I slightly modified this one from my “Building Blocks” program and ouff 🔥

This one is fairly quick but tough. I knew I was in trouble when I was shaking after the first exercise 🙈. If you have some weights but no rack, B-stance squats are a great option and much more challenging than they may seem. Unilateral everything is more brutal than it has any right to be 😝

🔹B-stance squats - 4x8-10
🔹Barbell hip thrusts - 4x12-15
ss single leg hip thrusts - 4x12-15
🔹Barbell RDLs - 3x8-10
🔹Chest supported rows - 4x10-12
ss Prone Ys - 4x10-12
ss Push-ups - 4x8-10
🔹Banded lateral walks - 2x30
ss Banded kickbacks (with a missing vid. Sorry!) - 2x20
🔺ss = superset - exercises are performed back to back before resting. 

The barbell hip thrust to single leg hip thrust superset (more like a drop set) was bruutal 🔥. I’ve been messing around with more agonist supersets (same muscles worked back-to-back) for home training programs for when you don’t have access to heavy weights. They are crushing me…in a good way.

My training frequency is definitely down from a year ago with lockdown and having a baby but that means I can mess around with more techniques going to failure and not be as concerned about not recovering for my next session. Silver lining 😂.

Kick butt you guys 👊🏻

Two new plans are out today: home and gym! This is from the home plan (Build & Burn 2). Both are the most challenging ones so far. I hope you like them, even if it’s in the “I hate you, Katie” kind of way 😝.

🔺Banded facepulls (vid is last)
🔺Divebomber push-ups
ss Negative push-ups (final set only)
🔺Dips or bench dips (weight optional)
ss Bicep curls
ss Rear delt raises
🔺Standing db shoulder press
ss Inverted rows
-
🔹Three sets for most and reps are between 8-15 (go to where you could only perform 1-2 reps more reps. The reps should be slower near the end vs beginning of your set with the same or more effort).

If you want an example of high effort and slow-moving weight, check the shoulder press video, hah. This building/rebuilding strength thing isn’t easy 🙈

If the push-ups are too challenging, start with the forward only portion. If you’re working towards push-ups on your toes, doing them on an incline is a great way to build up strength. You can even start on the wall (many do!) and progressively lower the surface as the reps get easier.

If you want to check out the new programs (or anything else on my site), come join at katiecrewe.com 🤗

⁣
Looking forward to starting my new program to get back to my very best shape. ⁣
⁣
How will I achieve this?↙️⁣
⁣
1. Get back to planning my meals at the start of each week (too many deliveroos) consuming higher levels of protein and reducing the crap 🍪🍩🍫🍰🍕🍟🍔 This will certainly help me drop body fat % being in a deficit. ⁣
⁣
2. Continuing with my GID live schedule 💪🏼💦 Workouts that have kept me in good shape throughout the year and helped thousands see incredible results. ⁣
⁣
3. Phone off tunes on spending just 30 minutes a day in the garden now the weather is better lifting heavy. Haven’t touched my barbell and heavier dumbbells properly in a long while. Looking forward to stepping it up 💪🏼⁣
⁣
3. Getting back into running with @man.like.roots instead of our longer walks. Nothing too intense but intense enough to improve the engine 🏃🏽‍♂️💨 @man.like.roots can run for miles he’s one hell of a dog 🐕💨⁣ 2-3 times a week
⁣
4. Daily Supplements including shakes to ensure I’m staying healthy and recovering well (I do this anyway) ⁣
⁣
5. Staying mobile, 10 minutes a day plus foam rolling to ensure I don’t put my body at risk of injury. ⁣
⁣
6. SLEEP - no more scrolling through Instagram watching reels of dogs at 12pm. Two chapters of a book instead and asleep by 11am the latest. ⁣
⁣
No huge changes just a few adjustments that will make a huge difference to my appearance and no doubt my self esteem. ⁣

I truly miss feeling athletic and I know being stuck at home isn’t particularly conducive to crushing high intensity workouts (or feeling like doing much of anything active 😩). I’ve been doing more conditioning and cardio circuits because 1) the format makes it feel a lot more doable, 2) they’re time efficient (and baby), and 3) endorphins 👌🏻

Workouts like this won’t make you more “toned” or build “leaner muscle”🙅🏼‍♀️. Doing a combination of resistance training and cardiovascular training for health is super beneficial but if you’re looking to increase your strength and definition, don’t be afraid to do workouts that utilize heavier weights and longer rest periods. Those should be the foundation of your training 👊🏻

🔸RDL to goblet squat
🔸Kettlebell swings
🔸Shoulder-tap push-ups
🔸Kettlebell deadlifts (or burpees)
🔸Pull-throughs from bear
🔷Performed in a circuit, 30 seconds ON and 30 seconds rest between all exercises. Repeat 3-4x.

I used a 40 lb kettlebell but feel free to use more than one weight. If I had something slightly lighter I would definitely have added in an overhead movement, like overhead reverse lunges.

Even though I did them and am showing you them, I’d probably recommend against the kettlebell burpees and just do the quick deadlifts. I have seen people topple over on unsteady kettlebells and I personally only want to go face to floor when I’m doing a push-up 🥴. Be very careful and only attempt if you feel comfortable and have a kettlebell with a wide base.

Happy Monday everyone 😊

You're a brilliant young man, who's got our Dad's humor and intelligence. Quick fact: Brandon graduated high school at 15 and earned his way on Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society at 16!!!! I won't share too much else as again he's quite shy unlike his big bro who poses on stages with little trunks on lol. 

Although our Father Don Heath has passed along with your Mom (my stepmom), you've always managed to excel in everything you do! Guess that's just how us Heath-Boys work right!

I went into pregnancy wanting all of the information I could get on how to safely and effectively train and spent the last year+ getting certified and learning as much about pregnancy and postpartum fitness as I could. It can be really overwhelming knowing where to start, especially with so many people sharing their opinions 🙃.

I wanted to create a hub where I could give pregnant people who want to continue to train the guidance and knowledge to feel safe and confident doing so.

⭐️ There are both home and gym plan workouts tailored to all phases of pregnancy, but the value is really in all the additional educational video content to help you understand the why and the how.

⭐️⭐️This isn’t a static document but access to a site that has videos for all plan exercises, additional informational videos, instructional videos, and will continue to be updated with more interviews with experts and information. We’re always listening to feedback to making additional content to further support and answer questions!

I’m really so proud of these and think there’s so much value and I hope you love them too! Go check them out! They can be purchased as a plan but all maternity content is also available for all members 🤗. I’ll be saving a story chat with more info about the programs and site tomorrow.

Postpartum program is still in the works! I’m doing my due diligence but I’ll get it out as soon as I can 🙈

Am I actually hungry?

Emptiness-in-my-belly hungry?

If not, all the mini Reese’s in the world won’t fix that feeling you’re feeling. See, food is incredible for fixing hunger. But it’s a poor substitute for connection, excitement, affection, rest, peace, order, adventure... legit anything that’s not hunger.

You’re not alone if you emotionally eat. More of the clients I’ve worked with than not once identified as emotional eaters. The good news is you can learn to manage emotion in non-food ways. It feels so good to honor how you’re actually feeling versus stuffing your emotions down with endless trips to the pantry.

This is something we’ll be tackling together in the Menopause Weight Loss Course. You have 3 more days to join. (Link’s in my bio)

It’s definitely what helped me out and gave me the building blocks and knowledge I have now. Everyone is looking for BALANCE, but what the f*ck is balance?! Personally, I think one can only derive at balance through rigidity. I am able to be where I am now only because I followed something and stuck to it, when That no longer served me I took what I learned and what worked and went on to another rigid routine. Because we are looking for the “one thing” that’s going to fix the problem, that’s going to change our lives. If there’s anything I’ve learned is that the “issue” never gets fixed, most of the time when you fix one thing it’s at the cost of another. If you don’t learn that what you see on the outside is only a reflection of your thoughts and habits then you will always be searching and no amount of anything will ever be enough. Balance is accepting the way things are NOW from everything you’ve learned because you’ve taken steps, steps forward, steps backwards and side steps here and there. You allowed those steps to take you to the next one, whether they led to the “right” place. I want everyone to understand that it doesn’t matter if you’re on the right path, the right path is only when you try to make the best decision for you, without judgment, without expectations. Balance is learning to let go and trust the isness of what is.

Attaining physical fitness, is far more reliant upon cultivating endurance (cardiovascular and muscular endurance), as well as strength, agility, mobility and coordination. ⁣
⁣
Unfortunately, because we are inundated with ‘slim’ bodies in the media we (understandably) make the assumption that a slim body is a fit body, and that a slim body is the only way to achieve a fit body. I also recognise that there are going to be elements of my page that perpetuate that message based on the fact that I am both slim and able-bodied. ⁣
⁣
SO - BEFORE I SHARE SOME TIPS: I want to reiterate (as I have done since I started this page) the gym/mat/training space is NOT the place for you to repent your ‘dietary sins’ because 1. There’s no such thing as a dietary sin 2. I encourage you to see training/exercise as an expression of appreciation for your body and it’s abilities. ⁣
⁣
To address this question properly however, is a non-exhaustive list of some suggestions I have to start out on a fitness journey:⁣
⁣
- Ignore the online HYPE - Increase your physical activity slowly but consistently. This might look like choosing to go for a 20 minute walk 3 times a week, increasing that frequency every 2-3 weeks if you feel ⁣
recovered (this is going to be VERY individual).⁣
⁣
- Split up your physical activity into morning and evening sessions - perhaps splitting up a podcast in between two walks so you’re motivated to do the second walk to get to the end of the podcast episode.⁣
⁣
- Track your weight - not the weight you lose, but the weight you lift. This is incredibly motivating and again removes you from the constant associations of exercise and fat loss.⁣
 ⁣
- Get adequate sleep this is often overlooked but it’s going to play a huge role in your mood, performance and recovery which in turn has the power to completely derail you. ⁣
⁣
⁣
SIDE NOTE: It’s true, that feeling of being out of breath is uncomfortable, but weirdly, you actually learn to love that feeling as you begin to associate it with the physical adaptations that will come from it.⁣

People love their strawman arguments & false dichotomies. Just because flexible dieting gives you the freedom to eat some junk food doesn’t mean that’s all you can or should eat

That is like saying keeping a budget means all you can do is buy sports cars, lottery tickets, boats, gold watches, & platinum teeth 😆. Sure if you keep a budget you COULD buy any of those things if it fits in your budget, but it doesn’t mean that’s a good idea because it might mean you can’t pay your mortgage/rent, utilities, clothes, etc.

By the same token, if your caloric budget is 1500 per day & you decide to spend 900 of that on a big slice of cheesecake, that only leaves 600 remaining. Gonna be hard to meet protein, fiber, & micronutrient goals on that intake. Also will be hard to feel satiated

On the other hand if your energy expenditure is high & your budget is 4000 calories per day, you might need to eat some calorically dense foods in order to meet your energy requirements without feeling completely stuffed & bloated. Yea it’s 900 calories of junk food... leaving 3100 calories remaining to still meet your nutrient requirements... easy

Flexible dieting is self regulating for people who don’t abuse it. For example, I eat ice cream daily in my offseason because I really enjoy it & I can still hit my nutrient requirements by eating it each day. It also prevents me from feeling like a bloated mess. However, when I’m dieting down & calories drop under 2500, I will choose less energy dense sources of foods by default. I rarely eat salad... til I’m dieting. Then I eat the shit out of it because it’s really satiating. I could have ice cream & protein powder instead but why would I want to when I’d still feel super hungry afterwards 🤷🏼‍♂️

@soheefit actually did a contest prep (she won btw) where she ate a snickers each day & still lost fat just fine. But the funny thing was that after a few weeks she did not want to eat the snickers because it was 250 calories & not very filling. She would have much preferred something less energy dense & more filling

That is what flexible dieting truly is, not the ALL JUNK FOOD DIET 🙄",When someone says flexible dieting is just eating junk food made with mematic,,,1.39,1.39,-1.18

I wanted to share this footage of myself to normalise and/or reinforce the reality that (often) gets left off apps like this;⁣
⁣
⁣
1. I don’t think we see fitness professionals and/or models eating enough. Normalise girls eating please - not just taking photos of their food. ⁣
⁣
2. Fitness Professionals eat sandwiches, or at least this one does. It’s not all protein pancakes and shakes and steamed veggies (as great as those things may be). A sandwich is a wonderfully convenient way to consume nutrient dense foods; but somewhere along the path it suffered some defamation. I love sandwiches and I wanted to normalise the idea of eating it incase you somehow felt it wasn’t ‘fitness’. ⁣
⁣
3. There’s a whole process that goes into creating a lot of the content that ends up online that, unless you’re producing it then you really don’t know exists. Which leads you to feel as though everything is just perfect, there’s not a hair out of place and that’s what fitness (and life) should look and/or feel like. My hopes is that by sharing this hashtag BTS you are reminded of all the stuff that goes on behind the proverbial curtains. ⁣

Waking up, doing the workouts, being sore, not eating the almond croissant when you see it giving you the side eye, it’s all a part of some form of suffering. 

But it’s suffering for the ‘greater good’ (hot fuzz voice). 

Should you neglect to suffer now, you’ll no doubt suffer later on in life when you pay the repercussions of not staying on top of your health seeking lifestyle. 

I said in an email this week: 

“Not proactively looking after your health with good diet and exercise is like leaving the front door wide open each night before bed.

There’s every chance nothing bad will happen. But if you wake up one day and all your cherished possessions are stolen from you in the night...

You’d probably have wished you locked the door every night before bed.”

However it will be too late at this point to lock it, the stuff is gone.

The suffering is going to happen at some point, that’s life... 

Don’t be fucking naive, you’re not going to get through this without facing the music at some stage in your life. 

Here’s the important part:

There’s a way to fall in love with the suffering when it’s on your terms. 

I’m not sure there’s a way to fall in love with the suffering when it’s not.

So when you construct your life and what you do in it each day, choose wisely.

Read & follow her!

Repost: Motivation is just a fleeting #emotion that needs to be backed ⬆️ with something #stronger ⁣
⁣
#Inspiration, doesn't last long. You gotta find something ➕ powerful to replace it with 👉that's where #MOTIVATION comes in. However its downside is that fluctuates & isn't very reliable despite being a big key in that intermediate phase of a journey i.e #dietingphase⁣
⁣
📍when motivation is ⬇️ you'll need something STRONGER than that to fill up those gaps of ⬇️ motivation:⁣
👉 so that's where #COMMITMENT & #INTENTION come into the game. Hence, even when you're not motivated you're still going to do whatever it takes & will stick to the PLAN.⁣
⁣
The key here is to have a #PLAN. If you dont have a plan you won’t have anything to stick to🤷‍♀️⁣
⁣
If you have a plan is easy, when your motivation is ⬆️, you stick to it. When it's ⬇️, you use your INTENTION & COMMITMENT to stay FOCUSED⁣
⁣
Now you can have all the intention of the world ( it's a promise, it's a dream), but it ain't enough, so here comes the #DISCIPLINE.⁣
⁣
This is something that uses #WILLPOWER to accomplish your #ADHERENCE up to where it needs to be. However, WILLPOWER has a limit & it can get burned out quickly & may not recover that easily so there's when #HABITS come in⁣
⁣
With HABITS all that stuff that requires motivation & WILLPOWER, gets automated, making ADHERENCE ➕ easier⁣
⁣
To create those habits you gotta have a structure such as simple & sustainable customized meal plans, strategies around behavior change, how to do meal prep, how to count macros, read labels, ongoing coaching & support. ⁣
⁣

Having children makes working on my posture incredibly challenging. Can any other mamas out there relate? 

Growing bub, having a cesarean, breastfeeding, carrying bub 24/7 and now that Paris is stronger I tend to favour a hip and push one side up higher than the other. (I’m consciously trying to evenly hold on both sides)

My core is weak (from 3 cesareans) & my lower back is now whack from it 🤪

Luckily I have been working closely with a chiropractor who has a keen interest in pregnancy & pediatric related conditions.
This has helped my diastasis recti, mild scoliosis, pelvic tilt & twisted hips.

So many people ask me if they can use our app @carbondietcoach (link in bio) to recomp. My answer is sure, but not many people can recomp to an appreciable degree. Those who can actually gain a significant amount of lean body mass (LBM) & lose a significant amount of fat simultaneously are mostly limited to the following groups:

-New to resistance training
-Returning to resistance training after a long layoff
-Obese
-People on steroids
-Any combination of the previous

Can others recomp? Sure, but it will be relatively minor. Most people want to build LBM with zero fat gain. Sorry, but you need to add mass in order to build LBM. You don’t have to get sloppy, but let’s just use basic logic

When I started lifting I was 140 lbs. I was about 8% body fat on calipers. Don’t you think I wanted to add slabs of LBM while getting shredded? Of course I did. But check this photo out from my last pro natural bodybuilding show. I was just over 190 onstage shredded. I had to add over 50 lbs of LBM over 15 years to get there. Do you HONESTLY think I could have added that much LBM without adding body fat? If so, then I’ve got a bridge to sell you

As you approach your genetic maximum, being in an energy surplus becomes even MORE important for building LBM. Muscle is energetically expensive tissue, why would the body add LBM that’s energetically expensive with no energy surplus when you already have a lot of LBM?

Im not saying you have to get sloppy. You don’t. Even when I was up to 230 lbs I was still in better shape than most people, I just had extra fluff. Then I used our app to cut back down to a leaner physique & guess what? That revealed all the LBM I had built

So sure, you can try to build LBM & lose fat staying the same weight. I tried to do that when I was a kid & I just spun my wheels for a year until I committed to BUILDING.

Here’s the good news, we tend to add a mix of LBM & fat mass when we gain weight with training (more LBM than fat in most cases). When we diet down properly, we lose preferentially from fat compared to LBM. Do enough PROPER gains & cuts & you will build something impressive",,,,1.34,1.34,-1.21

(Lesson 20: Resilience is best Served with Food)... “Despite swimming for up to 12 hours a day and burning calories like a furnace, I had to adhere to the research published in the journal Obesity Surgery, ‘It is a common belief that clinical vitamin or mineral deficiencies are rare in Western countries because of the unlimited diversity of food supply. However, many people consume food that is either unhealthy or of poor nutritional value that lacks proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fibre. The prevalence of vitamin deficiencies in the morbidly obese population is higher and more significant than previously believed.’
Athletes’ diets (and the nutrition of some people) are basically high in calories, but low in nutrients. Ina survival situation, any calories are good calories. But studies show when possible you should always choose nutrient-dense foods. ‘Ultra-endurance exercise training places large energy demands on athletes and causes a high turnover of vitamins through sweat losses, metabolism, and the musculoskeletal repair process. Ultra-endurance athletes may not consume sufficient quantities or quality of food in their diet to meet these needs. Consequently, they may use oral vitamin and mineral supplements to maintain their health and performance.’ (2010, International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism) 
This is an idea echoed by others. ‘Additionally, micronutrient needs may be altered for these athletes while dietary intake is generally over the Recommended Daily Allowance because of high caloric intake.’ (1991, International Journal of Sport Nutritionand Exercise Metabolism)
For that reason, the goal of every meal was always to eat calorie-dense and nutrient-dense foods during the hours I was awake and conscious (in the water or on the boat)” 🔱 #PerformSmart",,508889401,PhD Nutrition,1.33,1.33,-1.68

We often forget 1 litre weighs 1kg, so hydration and dehydration influence the scale so much. 

Bowel movements, even having your morning turd after your coffee is enough weight to get in your head. 

Sally from Slimming World would slap you round the head with her slipper for gaining a lb, the truth be told you haven’t had your morning shit yet.

Pro fighters often drop 5-10% of their weight before a fight. Almost all of it comes from water and water stored in carbohydrates inside muscle. 

10% for me is 9.5kg, that’s 20 lbs!

You wouldn’t sack a sales employee for having a day with little to no sales. 

So don’t be a dick when weighing yourself, keep the variables the same (usually empty bladder first thing). 

Accept there will be fluctuations and merely monitor the averages across time. 

One hot day doesn’t make a summer. 

Weight moves, all the time. It’s an accurate metric over time but not for those who can’t be pragmatic to handle the fluctuations.

I was once considered overweight, but I also knew my lifestyle wasn’t healthy. I binged on Burger King, alcohol, and smoked cigarettes here and there. I definitely didn’t work out! I was a broke, newly married nursing school student just trying to survive and my health was of the least importance.

When I did discover organic foods and healthy living, I started losing weight rapidly! This made me feel soooo good. However I started taking it too far.. until I was considered underweight. I would spend countless, wasted minutes in the grocery aisles reading the labels, counting calories. My diet per day consisted of Diet Coke, diet pills, healthy choice meals (200 cal per meal, if y’all don’t know), 100 calorie Campbell’s soups, and not touching anything with sugar in it. I still didn’t workout but I managed to lose 45lbs because I severely restricted my calories. I was miserable.

It wasn’t until I became a mom that I realized what true health meant-that it truly had more to do with the inside. If you improve your mental health, the outside will reflect that. don’t get me wrong, I’ve suffered from severe postpartum depression for many years and it’s always been a roller coaster for me. But as of today I can truly say I am on the right track.

Today, I don’t count my calories or macros and I’m working on my sobriety. I don’t omit any foods! I do CrossFit when I can and work out at home with my guides. I like to meal prep to save time and peace of mind, but I also like going out for sushi, pizza, and pasta with friends. I don’t do any special diets but I do eat in moderation.

I promise you, there is a perfectly healthy middle ground. A middle ground where you CAN love your body and not be extreme. It might take you a few years to find it like it did for me. But once you reach that balance, you’ll know! And it has nothing to do with how you look. 😉

Then maybe this journey might resonate!?⁣
⁣
START in the Diet Mentality: ⁣
You and exercise have a complicated relationship. In the past it may be tied to restriction, dieting & disorder. ⁣
You know it can’t go on like this together and are looking for another way. ⁣
⁣
MIDDLE in the F*ck It Phase: ⁣
You learned what Diet Culture is and how it’s played a role in your difficult relationship with food, exercise and your body and you say F*CK IT! You need a break and time away from your old exercise behaviours and time to experiment and figure out what works for you. ⁣
This part, could be weeks, months, years but it won’t be forever. ⁣
⁣
IN BETWEEN the f*ck it phase and the sweet spot: ⁣
You challenge the fitness rules, have fun trying different types of movement and work on strengthening the connection between you and your body, ⁣
⁣
END at the Intuitive Movement Sweet Spot: ⁣
This is where you have found your own version of balance. It will look different for everyone but at it’s core it’s a place where you can enjoy movement without immense pressure. You listen to your body & take rest when needed. ⁣
And you’re able to work towards goals in a flexible way (this is the principle of Gentle Guidance in practice). ⁣
⁣
This journey is different for everyone depending on our experiences in diet culture, and the external pressures of weight stigma and fat phobia. ⁣
⁣
But just so you know, you’re not alone on this path. It’s normal to take time away from exercise before you’re ready to gently re-introduce it! ⁣
⁣
You can hear me chat about this in last weeks episode of @thetrainhappypodcast with @zannavandijk & @victorianiamh. ⁣
But I hope this diagram gives more meaning and visualisation to that conversation.⁣

I actually don’t think this is the best outlook on goals 🤷🏻‍♂️

when people plan too much and we’re too fixated on how something should go any little speed bump is usually seen as a bigger problem than what it is! All because you now think -‘things are not going to plan’

I think it’s important to have a purpose and most importantly focus on that along with enjoying the present 

Looking to far ahead can sometimes not allow you to see what’s in front of you as clear. Don’t focus too far ahead it won’t allow you to kick with the wind which in essence may have a better outcome than your ‘5 year plan’

Worry about today and plan your day tomorrow, focus on routine and how to make the best out of today the rest will naturally come if you do it for long enough 

Ps: Not once in the last 5 years did I ever think I would be talking in front of 1000 people, but I always new amazing things will happen if I work hard enough.

When you stub your toe, do you turn around and stub the other?🦶💥

When you get a bad grade, do you purposefully flunk the semester? 📝❌

No.

You don’t do any of those things. (I hope)

So the question is…

Why let one bad meal or day of eating turn into weeks & months of eating poorly?

Why let one missed workout turn into weeks & months of sitting on the couch?

Look.

When you start a nutrition or exercise plan, you have every intention of giving it your all.

You want to do things *perfectly.* 👌

And while I commend you for the effort, there’s just one tiny problem...

Perfection doesn’t exist.

There will absolutely-positively be moments when you eat off-plan — even when you have every intention of staying on track...

There will absolutely-positively be mornings you wake up and don’t feel like going to the gym, even though you promised yourself you’d go the night before...

Shit happens, and that’s okay.

The most successful dieters have three things in common:

1️⃣ They do the right things most of the time.

2️⃣ They make mistakes occasionally.

3️⃣ When they make a mistake, they acknowledge it, learn from it, and get back on track.

Losing weight is just like everything else in life.

There are ups & downs & highs & lows.

Success comes when you stop chasing perfection and start chasing persistence in each moment regardless of what happened the moment before.

What you do MOST of the time matters most. 💯

~

When was a time you chose persistence over perfection?

If you aren't motivated, you'll never get started.

But if you want to lose weight and keep it off forever, you need to build discipline.

When you're motivated, it's easy to hit your nutrition targets and get your workouts in.

But no amount of motivation will keep you on track all of the time.

Sometimes, you'll end up eating more calories than you needed. Occasionally, plans will change and you'll have to skip a workout.

It’s easy to lose motivation in those moments…

… And when you lose motivation, it's a lot easier to beat yourself up for falling off track…

… And when you beat yourself up for falling off track, you're more likely to STAY off track.

You need to be able to stay on track, but you need to be able to get back on track too, and that's where discipline comes in.

How can you build more discipline?

One way is to identify (and work around) your weak spots.

For example, if you struggle with willpower, then you need to get better at planning.

At @leanerforlife, we make all of our clients schedule their workouts a week in advance. We also get them in the habit of planning their meals at least 24 hours ahead of time. 

(A strategy called ""24Before"")

This works because you’re more likely to stay committed to a promise you made to yourself than rely on willpower in the moment.

Another way is to start with a smaller commitment.

If you're struggling to exercise 4-5 days per week, start with just 2-3 days. 

Or even just one day!

Build discipline with a smaller commitment, and once you feel that you've mastered it, you can increase your level of commitment and start the process over again.

You have to be willing to forgive yourself too.

Discipline isn't built from perfection — it’s built from persistence.

Especially in the face of adversity. 

If you can learn to forgive yourself, you'll be in a better headspace to learn from your mistakes and, even better, use them as tools for growth.

It’s underrated because the process of dropping fat occurs over a longer period of time, depending on expenditure with moving and training 

Now when we’re trying to accomplish ‘a good physique’, work rate, consistency and patience is the most essential thing. 
It’s also the hardest trait to improve on because it requires a lot of discipline. 

Reasons I think maintenance calories for the long run are great 

1. Better performance in the gym due to energy levels 

2. Better recovery due to eating more 

3. Athletes tend to sleep better on higher calories 

4. Mental stability which helps athletes stay consistent with routine and training

5. General activity tends to increase with a higher caloric target #neatup247

6. Brain functionality is so much better

And the most important one 

7. You’re not a miserable bastard 🤷🏻‍♂️😂

There are many more benefits to being on maintenance calories, these are only a few and yes, you’re able to lose body fat and build muscle on maintenance calories but you have to be patient and train well ✊🏼 💪🏼

⁣
And yet many of us fear rest, feel guilty for taking time away from training and therefore don’t give our bodies the opportunity to actually respond to what we’re giving it.⁣
Very much speaking from personal experience here 🙋🏼‍♀️. ⁣
⁣
And if you’re training to improve strength, speed, endurance etc rest days are integral to improving! ⁣
⁣
So in the same way we might plan our workouts for the week, try scheduling rest days too.⁣
AND if your body is telling you it needs more than a day to rest, take as much time as you feel you need. ⁣
⁣
🔑 A key component of Intuitive Movement is UNCONDITIONAL PERMISSION TO REST. ⁣
⁣
Knowing that no. matter. what. it’s ok to rest.⁣
⁣
Through doing this we are taking the power away from the guilt, shame and fear that try to stop us from listening to our bodies and push us into the ‘no days off’ mentality. ⁣
⁣
And by building up that trust with our bodies, we start to learn our bodies cues for rest as well as movement. ⁣
And we also learn the difference between needing rest, and needing to just get our workout going with some gentle self discipline - but I think that’s a post for another day. ⁣

Now I used the term ‘revealing’ as it is a goal sort by many which is separate to building, just wanting to see those lines come through, is not the same as wanting to ‘build’ your abs. Clearly to build the abdominal muscles you need to train them, but there is a huge misconception that just training them in isolation, will miraculously emulsify the fat that hides them, it won’t.

This is why I always encourage those seeking abs to be mindful of their body fat, evaluate your starting position, you may decide that your time could be better spent on exercises that torch more calories and lower your body fat, than doing a 1000 crunches.

My hypothesis is that there would be a decline in the rate of claims (especially BS ones), possibly an increase in just entertaining content (at least there would be no real danger there) AND there would be a distinct increase in quality. ⁣
⁣
Now all that said, I am certainly NOT advocating for this ... What is so appealing about SM is that we can access bite-sized reminders and inspirations about human health habits. But health is so abstract and SM makes it WAY TOO EASY for people to make false claims by virtue of the halo effect (google it - so interesting). ⁣

Fitness is for you.

It’s not some kind of exclusive club you have to earn entry to (though I totally get that it can feel that way.)

What’s your biggest reservation about getting started? Tell me below.

We all started somewhere. And some of us started way later than others. (41🙋‍♀️)

If somewhere for you is walking a few minutes everyday- YES! Let’s go!

If somewhere for you is a single set of bodyweight squats- Boom. Get after it.

Let one step, however big or small lead to another and than another. The sum total of all those first steps will compound to long lasting positive results.

Don’t let fear of looking stupid or of being judged or failing keep your from experiencing the incredible mental & physical benefits that exercise can bring to your life.

This certainly is a loaded question, and while the answer may be yes you can “get away with it,” I want to discuss why it certainly isn’t optimal.
How is weight loss achieved? You eat less than you burn, simple. By taking the diet-only approach, you are influencing the “how much you eat” portion of the equation.

However, simply eating less for sedentary individuals may be difficult since their metabolism can be relatively slow due to low levels of muscle mass and physical activity, both of which influence metabolic rate. Additionally, as you start to lose weight your metabolic rate will decrease as an adaptive mechanism, which means you’ll have to eat even less if you don’t exercise!

So, what does exercise do? To answer this question, I want to cover a study by Willis et al., (2012), which compares the effects of aerobic, resistance, and aerobic + resistance (A+R) exercise on fat and lean mass in overweight and obese adults for eight months.

What happened?
At the end of the study, those who performed A+R lost the most amount of fat mass. This makes sense, since they were exercising the most, they had the highest energy expenditure. RE alone resulted in the least amount of fat loss. This also makes sense, RE doesn’t burn as many calories as aerobic training, so it resulted in lower fat loss. However, RE resulted in the largest increase in lean mass, followed closely by A+R, while those performing just aerobic exercise lost a bit of lean mass.

What does this mean? Exercise can help increase the rate of fat loss compared to just dieting. Also, including resistance exercise will attenuate losses of lean mass, which is a major reason why individuals metabolic rate tanks after losing considerable weight.

Overall, there is no reason to NOT exercise. Sure, dieting is a step in the right direction, but including exercise is just as important to help you achieve your physique goals!

His challenge is to do 100 Trap Bar Deadlifts as fast as possible. The weight for men is 100 kilos (220.5 lbs) and for women, 80 kilos (176.4 lbs).⁣

I have quite a ways to go to be able to not only complete it, but do it quickly haha. I need to add 50 lbs to the bar and lessen my leisurely rest periods quite a bit😏⁣

Often, people only see the reps of the glamorous exercises and prettiest pictures on here. Those are so amazing and inspiring, but there’s also a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes that is important too.⁣

Our newest Team Biolayne coach Dr. @josephmu94 breaks down the most recent research on the topic

Red meat consumption causes cancer!""

We’ve all heard this, right? I know several people who shy away from red meat for this reason. They’re not to blame, there’s certainly some scientific data suggesting that processed red meats contain compounds that may be carcinogenic like heterocyclic amines & polyaromatic carbons

However, when talking about whether a specific food causes a certain disease in humans, we need direct, clear, & convincing clinical data. Biological systems are complex, & the effects of a 
substance in a cell culture study may not play out the same way when introduced to a physiological system with many moving parts

This recently published meta-analysis by Maximova et al., (2020) investigated the associations between different levels of meat consumption (low, med, high) & cancer when co-consumed with fruits & veggies at different levels as well. I like this study design because it mimics real life. Most people don’t just eat meat in a meal. Typically, we consume it along with some plant-based foods

On slide 2 I summarize the results between unprocessed meat consumption & cancer. We see an elevated risk of cancer ONLY for the high meat consumers who also eat very low fruits & veggies. Every other combination of meat and F&V consumption was not associated with an increased risk of cancer compared to low meat & high F&V intake

Interestingly, the high meat & high F&V consumers actually had a numerically lower risk of cancer!! However, it was not statistically significant so we can’t just to conclusions

I think this study is a really good demonstration of why clinical data are important & we can’t make conclusive suggestions based on animal or cell culture studies. Again, our physiology is complex. The 
foods we eat interact during the digestive and absorptive process & may have different outcomes compared to their individual effects.

It’s not the end of the world, our composition should be full of ups and downs all year, Christmas, Summer Holidays and apparently Pandemics. 

Having too much body fat can cause issues down the line as systems in the body can’t do their thing, case in point T2 diabetes. 

But outside that, it’s just a protective mechanism doing it’s thing. Having the majority of our fat stores close to our centre of gravity make it easier to manoeuvre. 

I feel body fat gets more hate than it should, “cushin for the pushin” and all that. 

If you want to lose some of the stores:
- not a detox
- not a cleanse
- not a change in PH
- not a different eating window

Just reverse the process of how you attained the weight, find a calorie deficit and drop some of the fat. 

Some of it will find it’s way back I’m sure, but that’s life and the peaks and troughs of needing to diet, wanting to diet, needing time away from dieting and not wanting to restrict. 

None of which in my eyes are a bad thing. 

James","Body fat isn't a bad thing, it's really a double edged sword of a protection mechanism. 1) too much food consumed, prevent it from circulating and store it efficiently 2) not enough food consumed, utilise the stores to fuel you efficiently It's just doing it's job...

As many of you know, I lost 30 lbs from November of 2019 to November of 2020, culminating in my ‘Shred with Layne’ photoshoot with @sergey_yusin in Miami. I used the fat loss setting on my app @carbondietcoach (link in bio) to lose the weight, then switched to maintenance in the app after my photoshoot & have been on maintenance for the last 20 weeks or so. During that time I maintained within 2 lbs of my photoshoot weight the entire time, what can I say, the app nailed it

Last week I made the decision to begin a reverse diet in the app for a few reasons. 
1.  I want to try to slowly add some more lean body mass. Being that I’m likely close to my genetic ceiling after 20+ years of lifting, this isn’t going to happen without at least a small transient surplus
2. I want to get my energy expenditure up so that in the future I have a larger cushion to cut from it I want to shred to another level
3. I normally have good energy for training but having more calories will help me recover even more and push my strength further
4. Who doesn’t love to eat more?
5. All of 1-4 but I also want to minimize bodyfat gain

Now some people will claim you don’t need to reverse diet.. you don’t 🤷🏼‍♂️

Some people have said it isn’t magic... it isn’t 🤷🏼‍♂️

It’s simply another tool. I have seen some clients have crazy results with reversing where they lose weight while adding significant calories over time, even up to several hundred, even has high as ~1000! Now people will say “you’re saying they defy calories in calories out!”

Nope. CICO is a LAW

What is likely happening for these individuals is their increases in BMR & NEAT outpace their increases in calories, leading to a deficit even through caloric additions

I’ve never responded like that, I usually respond pretty standard to a reverse. But I’m starting a new kind of training I’m excited about & if it goes well I will be talking more about. So I’m ready to put these calories to good use

Swipe right to see my first reverse check in on @carbondietcoach 👉🏼

Funny enough, I actually LOST 😬

Who else is reversing? How is it going? How do you like it? Leave me a comment or question below! ⬇️",,,,1.12,1.12,-1.12

⁣
I got a comment from a woman who was super scared to start lifting weights because her husband “freaked out” that she would start looking like a body builder.⁣
⁣
So much to unpack here... but first:⁣
⁣
1️⃣No one has a right to be offended by the way your body looks. It’s YOUR choice to look how you want to look. ⁣
⁣
Whether we have more muscle, body fat, wrinkles, or whatever, our bodies are GOING to change and that’s ok. It’s not freaky, it’s normal.
⁣
2️⃣Putting on muscle is actually really hard. If it were that easy, you would see a lot more ripped dudes walking around. ⁣
⁣
It takes time, consistency, and hard work. It doesn’t happen overnight. Also, women have different hormones which make the process of building muscle a bit different. Regardless, it takes time and consistency. ⁣
⁣
💛All that to say, I wanted to give her (and you!) a hug and a confidence boost that you can be confident in how you look now without changing a thing AND you can also be excited about making healthy changes (if that’s what you want to do with your body). ⁣
⁣
💪Beyond that, just flex and do your thing.⁣

You don’t have anything left to prove to anyone?

“You’re too old”
“Too broken”
“The young guys have passed you by”
“The game has changed since you competed...”

I was talking about my journey through injuries the other day. In my lifting career I’ve been through:

-2 herniated cervical discs
-Torn right pectoral (required surgery & 18 month recovery)
-2 bulged & herniated discs in my lumbar
-Torn muscle in my left hip
-Partially torn left pec
-Adductor strain

And yet I’m still diligently working my way back to the platform

Why? I have already won nationals twice, won the Arnold, set a world record in the squat (been broken since), gold medal in the squat at worlds, and a silver medal overall at @theipf worlds in 2015

So why keep trying to comeback? This person was right... I don’t have anything left to prove to ANYONE

But it’s not about you or anyone else

It’s about ME. Because I still have something to prove to MYSELF

I still have a burning passion & desire to hit the platform again & mix it up. Yea these guys competing now are hitting insane numbers. Maybe I’ll never get back to another title. But... if I can train like I KNOW how I can train when I’m pain free & I know what I can do when it comes to gameday. I’m a hunter. The big meets I won I was NEVER the strongest lifter there. But when it’s show time, I don’t fucking miss. I would put so much pressure on my competitors because they knew I wasn’t going to make mistakes & if it was in my reach on the last pull, I was going to hit it. So they made calls they wouldn’t usually make

But maybe I’ll never win another title. That’s ok. What I would never forgive myself for would be quitting on something I was still passionate about simply because of setbacks or frustration

So I’m going to empty the fucking tank. Give it everything I’ve got. I may fail, but I will get way further & learn about my myself than if I just gave up because the mountain seemed too high.

I’m going to do whatever it takes. Maybe it’s not enough. But that will be because I gave it everything I had in the arena

505 x 3 tempo squats pain free. You may not see it yet, but I see it

I won’t tell you what to eat.

Because I’m not you.

I don’t want anyone telling me what to eat b/c, frankly, I’m in no way eating Lima beans, green beans or peas.

You don’t need a meal plan to lose weight, because meal plans are a band aid. A poorly fitting, germ infested band aid at that🤢

You are a grown woman and can choose what goes in your mouth. Pick proteins you like, pick fats you like, pick carbs you like. Carbs includes vegetables my friend so choose the ones you like or at the very least can tolerate. You can learn to like vegetables no matter how old you are. I did it at age 43.

Eat those things in proper portions so that you’re getting optimal protein, plenty of micronutrients and staying in a deficit of weight loss is your goal.

If you’re a woman over 40 and want me to walk you step by step through creating your own meal plans: hit the link in my bio to join my 60 day challenge.

Xx,
Kim

PS- tell me what food will 100% not be on any meal plan you make for yourself!

New plans dropping on my site starting this week! I’ve been doing the new home one for a few weeks now and it’s all of good ow😝🔥. There’s tons of great stuff on there and new content added every week 🤗

Glutes get a lot of attention but don’t neglect to strengthen the front of your legs too! Here are some non-barbell/non-machine exercises you can try at home (or the gym if you’re lucky enough to be back there) to target your quads.

☀️Elevated bear squats with band resistance
☀️Skater squats (I did counterweighted and limited rom with a block)
☀️Heels elevated goblet squats
☀️Kneeling leg extensions (can adjust rom to make easier or harder)

Because people always ask, this isn’t a workout with reps/sets. I wouldn’t suggest doing all of these in the same workout. More isn’t always better! Pick one or two in a workout to try.

If the kneeling leg extensions are too challenging, you can try limiting your range of motion or using a band for assistance by attaching it to a banister or something else sturdy and putting it behind your glutes. As you go backwards, the band stretches and helps you to get out of the bottom position.

If any of these make your knees feel “less than great”, you can always try modifying so your posterior chain contributes a little more. E.g. do regular goblet squats or even do them to a box to limit forward knee travel or swap reverse lunges for the skater squats.

Go forth and smash thy quads (with great form 😝👊🏻)

1. Put yourself and your goals first. Sometimes you have to be selfish and block out the negative dramas around you which could so easily be holding you back from reaching your full potential. Once you’re free from the negative energy you’ll have the time and focus to do what’s best for you and your VISION 👊🏼

2. Optimistic approach to everything you do. Don’t doubt yourself, don’t be scared to fail. Visualise the best outcome of every situation and go for it. You’ll be left behind with a pessimistic approach. 

3. Self Compassion! Don’t be so hard on yourself, don’t always have to be the tough guy who just gets on with it. Accepting your current situation and dealing with the problem with a thought out solution will get you a lot further than hiding away from your failures/stressful situations. Don’t do it 👊🏼

4. HEALTH. Looking after your health should be a priority. Eat healthy, avoid large consumptions of alcohol and junk food, sleep 8 hours and workout regularly. Build your strength with weight training and your fitness with cardio. How do you expect to reach you full potential without being physically fit? A fit body will result in a healthy mind, Has to be done 👊🏼

5. Collaboration - who are your connections ? who are you surrounding yourself with? People who want to see you succeed or people who are more than happy to see you fail. Delete and move on from those who stop you 👊🏼
Positive energy always!! 

6. Belonging! Find your belonging don’t waste your time doing something you don’t enjoy, something that doesn’t test your skills. What are you passions? what best suits your characteristics? 
Enjoying what you do finding your purpose will bring progress. 
Don’t fall into the trap of ‘this will do’ because you can achieve better 💪🏼

And not just for restorative practices.

Props are NOT for beginners and by using one it does NOT mean you’re doing it “wrong”. I remember when I first started practicing I never took a block, a strap or a bolster with me to my mat. I practiced very much from a physical egotistical space, thinking that these ‘things’ would just make me look rubbish and not understanding why I might find them useful. Needless to say I was practicing asana, but I was worlds away from practicing YOGA. Fast forward 11 years of yoga being in my life and I can safely say that props have been a big part of my journey and I love them. Even if I don’t end up using them in a practice, they will always be close to my mat, just in case.

Have you experienced a similar relationship with props?

I think we should make some lovely @mysoulsanctuary props...
What d’you think!? 😜 Ethically and sustainably made of course. ❤️",,,,1.01,1.01,-1.88

Read that again. 

And again.

Because what’s holding you probably back isn’t your diet or exercise plan. 

It’s the story you‘re telling yourself.

The story being that you are “broken” now and have to be “punished” with a weight loss plan to “fix” yourself. 

☝️ That’s some bullshit. 

You are not broken.
You don’t need to be punished.
And you don’t need to be fixed.

You’re just not satisfied with where you’re at right now, and that’s totally okay. 

But if you ARE unsatisfied, you have to either choose to accept it or change it.

If you choose to accept it, then you can’t beat yourself up about it. 

If you choose to change it, you need to be ready to embrace the suck that comes early on when you’re just getting started.

Embrace it, learn from it, and keep going. 

With time, you’ll suck less and less, and before you know it, you’ll be one of those people who figure out the “secret” to getting results. 😉

If you don’t take care of your body, it won’t take care of you. And as much as you may love smashing out the workouts, if you don’t pay the same attention to your recovery, it will soon catch up with you and have you sidelined! 

This may look painful (understatement!!) but, for me, a physio session with the best in the game @medicalhomevisit is one of my favourite things to do. Self-care is so important and I’ve been seeing the team @medicalhomevisit for almost two years now. When was the last time you really took some time out for a bit of self-care? With lockdown easing, maybe it’s time to get yourself booked in for that massage you’ve been putting off for waaaaay too long! Don’t do what I used to do and wait for an injury before you get seen to. Prevention is the best cure!

⁣
Imagine a the difference between a bodyweight push up and a dumbbell chest press. Provided you choose a light weight, the DB Chest press is actually EASIER than the push up. ⁣
⁣
Don’t be fooled into thinking that just because you’re a beginner that you don’t need weights; I would argue that if you’re a beginner YOU DO NEED WEIGHTS because they can help to build the strength gaps that are preventing you from performing some of those body weight based exercises that you’re not quite able to do yet. ⁣
⁣
That said, I don’t want to dishearten anyone that is experiencing financial difficulty right now - there are ways to create resistance with relatively cheap items (I’ve shared these workouts before).⁣
⁣
But I felt the need to:⁣
⁣
a. normalise beginners using weights ⁣
⁣
and ⁣
⁣
b. dismantle this notion that bodyweight workouts are strictly for beginners; try saying that the next time you try bodyweight gymnastics drills. ⁣

Today marks a year since my very first live workout on here for you all

And as you can see from the start of the video I was not used to teaching virtually.... !!

At this point I remember loads of members of the gym I was teaching at (@f45_training_islington) saying how they were worried about going a few weeks without gym classes so I thought I’d brave doing some live Instagram workout for them - and anyone else- to join in with

Little did I know that 12 months down the line I’d spend an entire year teaching thousands of you from my home

You’ve all become my community of powerhouses and getting your messages, seeing your progress photos and just getting to workout with you all has been the most incredible pleasure

And it’s very much not over yet! I wanted to upload this first ever workout to remind me- and all of you- how much we have achieved this year.

Today I’m going to share some of the incredible messages and transformations on my stories and if any of you haven’t already - please send me your stories or photos or anything!

For a lot of people it’s easier to answer why they don’t like running than why they do. Why?? A good run is like medicine for the soul! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told, “I can’t run.” It’s like people expect there is some magical technique or test that marks people who can run from people who can’t. NONSENSE. If you run, you’re a runner. End of story. 

If you don’t feel ready or confident enough to get running, start small. Start with a slow walk, pick up the pace each time you go, then when you’re ready, pick it up to a light jog. You don’t have to time it, you don’t have to map it or track it. If you’re just starting out, just go until you can’t. Then walk. Then go again if you think you can. Don’t overcomplicate it. Running is that simple.

You could eat a banana nut muffin & a glass of OJ from the local mini mart for breakfast, a large cake -in-a-cup coffee concoction mid morning, a burger from McDs for lunch and a Coke and chicken fingers for dinner. 

Or for less calories but *more* food eat:
✅ A banana, big bowl of oats and some Greek yogurt  for breakfast.
✅ A massive salad with greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, carrots, & peppers, grilled chicken and a sweet potato with cinnamon for lunch.
✅An Apple and some air popped popcorn for snack 
✅ A salmon filet with a side of roasted broccoli and rice for dinner.
✅ And even a small chocolate chip cookie for dessert

If you haven’t tried this way of eating, give it a shot. Not only will you be in a better position to lose weight, you’ll be more satisfied & of course healthier.

Enjoy your weekend!

The short answer is no. They may contribute to an overall energy deficit by virtue of the effort it takes to execute them, but even then, exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT) contributes to a relatively small portion of your Total daily energy expenditure …⁣
⁣
BUT THAT’S OK RIGHT? BECAUSE THAT’S NOT THE REASON WE DO AB EXERCISES. ⁣

⁣
Let me know how many rounds you did.

*can we also put a restriction on the use of this word from anyone above the age of 8. Also tummy is short for stomach right? Which is an organ. So this whole flat tummy association with low subcutaneous fat is just convoluted and needs to be rectified and clarified by trainers, rather than perpetuating the use of these terms.

For as long as I could remember, this bothered me-so much that I threw all of my shorts away! As I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more comfortable in my skin. I realized there are bigger things to worry about such as the health of my kids, world hunger, and taxes. Seriously... cellulite... over 90% of women have it. It’s quite silly that we have come to demonize something so common! What gives?

Put on that swimsuit. Wear those shorts. Stop letting your body control you! You’re only given one life to live and I doubt you would want to miss out on 95% of that life to weight 5% less. Am I right?

I don’t care about any cellulite creams or fascia blasters. My cellulite fluctuates just as my weight does. The best way to minimize the appearance of cellulite is by lowering your overall body fat percentage through regular exercise (cardio + weight lifting) and a diet low in sodium & saturated fat while staying away from excess sugar, alcohol, and nicotine (toxins). That’s it.

The truth is, most of us might not ever get to completely get rid of it. And that’s OK. It’s all down to genetics at the end of the day. But that is really all you can do so save your money and practice self-love while improving your daily habits. 🖤",,,,0.95,0.95,1.92

This post is for you. No, this is not fitness related. But it’s something that I felt called fo share.

I’ve been single for a few months. Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I was single for this long.. I was maybe 17 or 18 years old? Being single seemed like such a scary thing to me, something I did not want. I had the biggest fear of being alone up because I was sooo co-dependent. But I realized something.. being single is a superpower.

I do go on dates here & there, but I come home to me, myself, and I. I rely on myself and for the first time, I don’t feel like I need anyone. I don’t call anyone mine-I am my own. Wow. What a power to have!

Being single has also made me a better mom. I get to put 100% of my attention to my kids during this time. I have zero distractions in my life and they get the full me. These are the most important years of their lives and I want to be there for them 100%.

Being single has also allowed me time to reflect, grow, and do inner work. Separating from my husband really showed me a lot of what I needed to resolve within myself. I got closer to Christ, I quit relying on alcohol to soothe my depression and anxiety, and I started becoming a better friend.

Does it get lonely? Of course, sometimes. At times I wonder if I’ll ever find the one 🤣 I swear that I’ve gotten so picky!

The reason why I am sharing this is because I know that some of you ladies are probably struggling right now with being single. I’ve been told that this season won’t last forever and I do believe that. I was also told that once you stay single long enough you won’t want to start dating again. I didn’t believe it at first, but that’s so true 🤣 I love it!! I never thought I would say that. Getting to do what I want, when I want, without someone else limiting me. It’s awesome!

If God (or your higher power) has called you to be single right now, use this season for yourself. Use it to get closer to Him. Use it to change bad habits. Use it to find out what you truly want in life. Use it to envision your perfect ideal partner and teach yourself to not settle just to be with somebody.

Enjoy singlehood. It won’t last forever. 🖤",,,,0.93,0.93,2.21

I’m not talking about those of you who snapped something up from deadlifting something that was too heavy. I’m talking to those who go about life with general low back pain (LBP) on a daily basis. Guess what, you’re not alone.

According to Georgetown University, nearly 16 million Americans report persistent or chronic LBP. The question is, what do you do about it?
The last thing many people want to do may actually be one of the most beneficial… Lift weights! Many people with LBP may shy away from resistance training due to the fear that lifting heavy things will aggravate their pain & think they need to just rest to reduce the pain. WRONG! Lifting weights has been shown in several studies to improve LBP💪🏻

Chronic LBP may result from a sedentary lifestyle which is typically accompanied by weight gain, perceived disability, & decreased physical function, NOT because “you’re really injured”. Exercise on the other hand can improve these conditions.

A study by Cortell-Tormo demonstrated that a 12-week progressive resistance training program improved general LBP as well as physical fitness (measured in total repetitions performed in exercises like the squat & bicep curl) compared to sedentary controls (slide #3)

Strengthening of the muscles of the back & core seems to be the main mechanism by which resistance training reduces LBP. These results have also been supported by meta-analysis that look at the sum of literature on resistance training & chronic LBP with very large effect sizes on reducing LBP!

General considerations: Resistance exercise is not the only modality of exercise which has shown to improve LBP. Yoga, aerobic exercise, & Pilates all have been shown to improve back pain. The main message is… EXERCISE! The main reason I wanted to cover resistance exercise specifically is because so many people are afraid to do it when they have some pain. Additionally, lifting weight will make you look better in the process!

That said, if you have suffered an acute low back injury, you may need to rest it until you can get to a pain level that allows you to resume lifting weights",,,,0.93,0.93,-1.34

~

01 - You’re not in a calorie deficit.

It doesn’t matter how “clean” you eat, how hard you work out, or how many supplements you guzzle down.

If you’re not in a calorie deficit, you won’t lose weight.

That doesn’t mean you have to count calories,but calories count, whether you count them or not.

Now, in my opinion, keeping a food log alongside calorie counting is the best way to ensure you’re being consistent.

And when you go about it the right way, it can actually help you develop a better relationship with the foods you come in contact with on a daily basis.

But whatever you choose to do, you need to be in a deficit.

~

02 - You ARE in a deficit, just not consistently

Getting in a deficit isn’t the hard part — it’s staying in a deficit long enough to see results.

And that’s because most people have unrealistic expectations for how quickly weight loss should happen.

They expect to see multiple pounds every week, and when that doesn’t happen, they get discouraged.

Another reason it’s is because of the unsustainable methods people use to create their deficit — usually something that requires you to eliminate carbs or sugar.

Eliminating can help you eat fewer calories, but it’s not sustainable for most people — especially if it forces you to overhaul your entire way of eating.

~

03 - You aren’t fully invested

When motivation is high, it’s easy to commit to a new diet and exercise plan.

But motivation eventually goes away, and if you aren’t invested in the process, your chances of success are slim to none.

The most obvious form of investing is a coach or program.

But you don’t have to spend money to get invested.

You could also find an accountability buddy or join an online support group like the free LFL Facebook community.

You could also create a reward system where you buy yourself something new at different progress milestones.

What matters is that you invest yourself into the process beyond your own motivation and will.

Sometimes less is more, so don’t be afraid to slow down your exercises. Tempo reps increase your time under tension but they’re also great for helping you to nail your form so that every rep counts. Only problem is, slowing things down is easier said than done when you throw a 2-year-old into the mix. Nevertheless, we move 😎

Ramadan Mubarak! I get inundated with questions about training during Ramadan so this year I’ve decided to compile as much as I can into one blog post. If you’re fasting for Ramadan and worried about losing muscle mass or gaining weight, or want  to know when the best time to train is, head over to my blog now to have a read. It’s also an interesting read for any of my non muslim followers who might want to learn a bit more about the topic. I’m also adding more workouts to my Ramadan IGTV series for you which contains low intensity, low impact workouts that are suitable for doing before or after Iftar. As I always say during Ramadan, you know your body and what you’re capable of, so you choose the time you do them. I hope this helps any of you looking for a bit of consistency and guidance when it comes to training during the holy month. Ramadan Kareem to all my brothers and sisters. I’m wishing you all a healthy, safe and blessed month 🙌🏽 To read the blog, head to my website www.pmafitness.co.uk (the full link is in my bio.)

I’ve had so many questions about this and the answer isn’t one size fits all. You have to listen to your body and do what feels right for you as we all respond differently to fasting. I tend to strength train in the day, BUT I’ve been doing that for years and my body responds well to it. Ramadan isn’t the time to start training if you haven’t exercised before. Your health is the priority and you must ensure any training you do is done safely. In general, I’d recommend the following to the majority:
*If you’re trying to maintain muscle mass, I’d personally try to limit cardio to twice a week and do after iftar rather than before
*Largely, I’d recommend people who wish to train before iftar try training at a lower intensity or try something like a brisk walk
*If you want to continue with higher intensity workouts, try breaking your fast on something light like coconut water and dates beforehand
*Heavy weight training is usually best saved for before suhoor so you can refuel adequately within the “golden hour”
*Be realistic. You may well lose some mass during Ramadan because it’s hard to train so late at night. This is ok! If you maintain some sort of training and consistency, you’re on the right path so don’t panic. 
Focus on your internal health rather than the aesthetics. I’ve created an IGTV RAMADAN TRAINING SERIES with some low intensity workouts, be sure to check them out. Share & Tag a friend or relative below who might benefit from them, hope you’re having a blessed month 🙏🏽🌙

At the end of each circuit we perform a 40 second cardio move before moving back on to our weights.

But here’s a bit of info.  I began bodybuilding when I was in college while studying Exercise Science.  It’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I’m at now. I didn’t rush the process. I did it at my own pace, and was able to avoid any serious injury over the course of 20 years of training. I completed my degree in Exercise Science and a part of obtaining that degree requires you to pass multiple training certification tests as well. 

So I’ll be sharing not only my knowledge from what I learned in my studies but also what I’ve learned in my experience as a collegiate athlete, consistently competitive bodybuilder for going on 20 years (amateur and professionally) and personal trainer. 

I was the guy that they said would never amount to much in the sport of bodybuilding. I had a lot of weaknesses that I worked to overcome. And it led me to become the 15th @mrolympiallc 💪🏿 I wasn’t supposed to achieve what I have managed to achieve...but I did. 😎

If your arms are roasted after Lat Pulldowns, you’re doing them wrong. Your arms are a lever for your lats. 

Don’t let your thoracic spine arch excessively during the movement as well. Think about your body remaining vertical and controlling the weight with your lats. Yes, you can have a subtle arch but nothing excessive.

Yesterday @thatgirlkisha came in to teach some more dance classes and to say we had fun is an epic understatement! This woman literally embodies what it means to find joy within movement and inspires us all to step out of our comfort zones and try something new! Even if we’re terrible at it, even if we have two left feet on the dance floor, even if we are embarrassed... (all me! 🙋‍♀️) There’s nothing more liberating and freeing than pushing past all the chatter in your head, setting your ego aside and being willing to get uncomfortable.⁣
⁣
This is me being willing to get uncomfortable (dancing!!) and I ended up loving every minute of it! 💃🙌⁣

I loved wrestling Kenny around the world and we had some classic matches.

On this night I took a hard suplex and the impact damaged blood vessels in my lungs causing the blood to come up. 

Kept composed, made sure I could breath and continued with the match. 

I’d like to think Ken would’ve shown me some compassion, but his facial expression says “f*ck your bleeding lungs” as he tries to rip my ankle from my tibia

If it works for you, and you genuinely enjoy it, then keep at it.

But idk.

I just don’t get it. 🤷‍♂️

Why follow a diet that force so much restriction and lifestyle change when there’s a scientifically proven way to lose weight that doesn’t require a single bit of elimination?

You have to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. (SCIENCE 🤓)

You can either create a bunch of rules about what you can and can’t eat in hopes that it’ll create a deficit…

OR

You can learn how to use moderation and portion control to create a deficit and never have to be that person who’s always declining dinner invites with, “sorry, I’m on a diet.” 

Both are hard, but I’d argue that one comes with a much larger upside and a flexible fitness lifestyle.

The choice seems obvious to me...

But hey, what do I know? 

I’ve only lost over 145 pounds and kept it off, helped hundreds of clients get results, and helps hundreds of thousands more with through my posts and emails. 😉

Following on from yesterdays post regarding weight training here is a simple upper body sequence using dumbbells:⁣
⁣
A1. Push Ups (if you’re not able to do these yet, just work on the eccentric portion, lowering down for a count of 4seconds, optional 1second hold at the bottom - this will also help to strengthen push ups if you can do them, but have hit a strength plateau) 4 sets, 8 reps.⁣
⁣
B1. Skull Crushers (tricep strength is an imperative for yogis - I mean for everyone, but definitely yogis - get this into your repertoire but ensure you’re keeping forearms parallel, do not let elbow spray out to the sides) 4 sets, 12 reps⁣
⁣
C1. Standing lateral raise (I had to swing a little here which I wouldn’t normally encourage, but when you don’t have lighter weights, that can be an option, provided you try to lower down slowly). 4 sets, 12 reps⁣
⁣
D1. Standing Bicep Curl (just out here tryna normalise girls with big biceps because they’re important muscles) 4 sets, 15 reps. ⁣

I do! This is the end of my 2nd week of reverse dieting using my app @carbondietcoach (link in bio) & my calories are up, energy is up, weight has barely moved (less than half a lb total) & my caliper measurements are still the same! Things are going so well, the app increased my calories a bit! Swipe right to see my check in 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼

Before anyone says anything, I am aware that I’m not REALLY 6.1% body fat. But that is what calipers are putting me at. I don’t really care what the real number is, I just use these measurements for comparisons. The fact is that NO measures of body fat are truly accurate unless you want to die & have your adipose tissue excised out of your body & weight. Na I’ll pass thanks!

So why reverse dieting? Well I enjoyed the dieting process & honestly @carbondietcoach made it stupid easy for me to drop 30 lbs last year. Then once I hit my leanest state I switched to maintenance mode on the app... & that’s exactly what the app did. Maintained me within 1.5 lbs of my end of cut weight for almost 5 months!

Now that I’ve healed up a few injuries it’s time to get BACK to crushing some weights. Since the limit of my weight class in powerlifting is 93kg (205 lbs) it doesn’t really make sense for me to stay here at a full pound under. So my plan is to reverse diet using the app for the following reasons:

1) More calories to fuel my performance in the gym 🔥

2) Increase my lean body mass while minimizing fat gain😈

3) Maximize my energy expenditure so that when I go to cut back down in the future, I can get even leaner, with even less effort 😎

4) And who doesn’t like more food?🍔🌮🥙🥪🥗🍕

Honestly the app makes it so easy. I just pick my goal, select how conservative or aggressive I want to be, then just log my food, log my weight daily, check in weekly with the coach, & the app takes all the guesswork out of my adjustments. Swipe right to check out my weekly update 👉🏼👉🏼👉🏼

Over 30k people trust our app to coach them, including @hollytbaxter & myself. At less than $10/month it’s a no brained. I can honestly say I’m so proud of this app

(And that’s just for the US)

Yet as a nation, we are more overweight and obese than ever before.

Clearly, there’s a disconnect between what people *think* they need and what they actually need to be successful.

As a teenager going into my young adult years, I fell victim to this industry over and over again.

I followed the same pattern every year:

🔄 I’d get a burst of motivation to lose weight…

🔄 I’d start whatever diet was most popular at the time…

🔄 I’d get some quick results in the first few weeks or months…

🔄 Eventually, I’d burn out and gain all of my weight back plus some. 

It’s a sucky cycle, to say the least.

But the addictive nature of the cycle is what makes it vicious. 

With each failed weight loss attempt comes impatience, and that impatience makes it easier and easier to fall victim to diets and programs that promise unrealistic results.

So how can you get out of this cycle once and for all? 

You have to realize there’s no amount of motivation or discipline that’ll end the cycle. The only way out is to reframe the way you think about fitness and weight loss as a whole.

𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲 𝘄𝗲𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗶𝘁 𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘆, 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗳𝗶𝘁𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿.

It’s not sexy or marketable.

I can’t sell it to you for 3 easy-peasy payments of $29.99.

But it’s the truth.

And the sooner you accept it, the better.

Because once you do, it’ll be a hundred times easier to stop falling for unsustainable diet and exercise programs that waste your time, money, and energy.

And START following diet and exercise advice that fit your lifestyle forever.

But they’re also full of slow release energy and protein to help sustain me through a day of fasting. I make a big batch of soaked oats with a mix of oats, nut milk, chia seeds and ground sweet cinnamon and use that as my base. It keeps in the fridge for a few days in an airtight container. I then serve up a portion for suhoor and add whatever I fancy. Swipe across for my favourite flavour combos during Ramadan and see below for what what I add to the soaked oats mix to make them. 

Carrot cake oats: Grated carrot, small splash vanilla essence and a handful of raisins. Topped with chopped walnuts and sprinkle of desiccated coconut. 

Berry boost oats: Mash some raspberries into your oat mix, with a splash of vanilla essence. Top with berries of your choice and desiccated coconut. Pad it out with some pistachios or almonds if you have some. 

Tropicana oats: Coconut milk or a splash of coconut water works well with your oat mix on this one. Stir in some desiccated coconut and a mashed banana. Top with pineapple and mango. 

I don’t measure anything, I just do it by eye. But when you add chia seeds for the protein and omega 3 benefits, you need quite a wet mixture because they soak it right up. I’ve put a story up to show you the base mixture if you want to give it a go. Don’t forget, you can add protein powder to your base oat mixture if you want to fill yourself up even more during Ramadan (or are eating these post-training throughout the year.) “FAISAL35” will give you 35 per cent off on the @phdnutrition website if you wanted to grab some protein to try any of the above.

Dozens & dozens of ladies have signed on to build their strongest, healthiest, fittest body yet. Hit the link in my bio to see what it’s all about & join them.

The course comes with a 6 week progressive strength training program that can be done in your home gym, speaking of which:

The most important piece of equipment you need in your gym is dumbbells. The adjustable ones are a good option if maximizing space is important. Whatever kind you choose, don’t stop with 3s, 5s, 8s, 10s & 15s. You are underestimating your own strength. You can lift more than 15lbs & will need those 20s, 25s, 30s, 35s, 40s etc to give your body the stimulus it needs to adapt (read -get strong, toned & defined.)

If you try to base your home gym around bands you will be frustrated w/ your lack of progress over time. But for sure get the long loop bands in a variety of thicknesses. In combo w/ an over the door pull up bar you will be able to train your back. (You don’t have to start with pull ups: there are loads of pull down variations. But also: you *can* do pull ups.)

An adjustable bench will be useful. Sure you can get away with your ottoman & the floor, but you’ll be able to do a much wider variety of exercises w/ the adjustable bench: incline chest press variations, batwing rows, & chest supported rear delt raises, to name a few. I have clients who’ve bought foldable ones if space is an issue. Check out the rest of that 2nd slide for more useful equipment that will fit in most people’s long term budgets/spaces.

Now slide 3: maybe it’s not realistic for your space.  But if you have a garage, basement, or spare bedroom, get your hands on a barbell, plates & a rack. I want you to experience the transforming power of the iron. You are already stronger than you realize &  have the capacity to be so much stronger. The physical strength you can build with barbells pales in comparison to the inner strength that builds right along with it. There is something magical about challenging yourself physically. It is transformative.

If every co-worker gets a birthday lunch and you treat every single one like it’s your birthday…
 
It’s gonna be hard to reach the level of consistency you need to see real fat loss progress. Every week having a “special event” isn’t conducive to fat loss.
 
Look, I’m not here to tell you what’s special and what’s not. You get to decide that for yourself because you’re a grown woman. I’m just here to push you to question yourself. The next time you think “it’s a special occasion, so I’ll just eat…” question yourself.
 
One more unpopular opinion: not all special occasions need to be celebrated with food.
 
That likely feels wrong because it’s just what we do- big thing, fun thing, exciting thing happens- we go out for ice cream, cake, pizza…
 
But what if sometimes, we celebrated by going for a hike to see an incredible view or going dancing, or literally any fun non-food bit of specialness you can create. There are loads if you can get out of the special occasion = food mindset.
 
Hope this helps!

You dig through the pantry, shrugging your shoulders with a feigned look of bewilderment on your face. “I don’t see it here Buddy.” (In case any of my kids are reading along, I have never , ever done this👀)

Yeah, your chances of “finding” motivation are slightly better than your kid finding that candy.

2 pieces of good news though:

1. You don’t need motivation nearly as much as you think.

Think of all the things you do just because you value the outcome of doing that thing. Teeth brushing is the perfect example. You’re not pumped to brush your teeth every morning & night. You’re  not putting the Crest on the brush because you’re feeling it. You do it because you don’t want a mouthful of cavities. You do it so your partner won’t cringe when you go in for a kiss. Think of your fitness habits like brushing your teeth. You don’t need to wait around feeling motivated to eat more protein or go outside for a walk any more than you need to feel motivated to brush your dang teeth. Make a decision. And then take a small step forward. Walk for 5 minutes. Chop some cucumber and eat it with your favorite dressing. Grill some chicken & portion it out into individual containers.

Decide. And move.

2. You can create motivation as you get that forward motion going. One little step and then another becomes a habit. That habit brings results.

Results are, wait for it...

This is why research conducted at Harvard Medical School said, “Considering the total carbohydrate-based energy reserve from muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, and plasma glucose, it becomes clear that normal carbohydrate stores alone would be insufficient to fuel a marathon.” The solution? Add fat. This is because research published in the American Journal of Physiology found working muscles consume a mixture of metabolic substrates, and the relative contributions of fat and carbohydrate to this mixture dynamically depend on exercise intensity and the size of available glycogen reservoirs. It’s concluded, “Carbohydrates account for a greater proportion at higher intensities, while fat accounts for a greater proportion as available glycogen is depleted.”","LESSON RESILIENCE BEST THE POTENT FAT-CARBS FUEL LOCATION LOATION:OfordN DISTANCE COVERED: 730miles SEA:14 ENCE ATEGIES But mmune immu- witha riereque support FOR while need ND REAKABLE BODY OF THE ING s our It's8:23 p.m. finishline the from Sports often-quoed Lommittee Consensus speed athletes day.

Eating too much hyper palatable processed food high in carbs AND fats make you hungry! 👉🏼

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading comorbidities associated with weight gain & obesity. Since diabetics struggle with proper carbohydrate disposal due to insulin resistance, dietary strategies that reduce carbs have become popular for T2D

So T2 diabetics should just eat less carbs right?

Saying eat less carbs to a diabetic to manage their T2D is like putting a band aid over the symptom & not necessarily addressing the root cause. There is plenty of data suggesting that reducing body fat can improve insulin sensitivity & glycemic control independent of the type of dietary intervention used. What’s one of the major issues associated with eating less?
Hunger! Which makes it extremely difficult for some individuals to eat in a caloric deficit. Therefore, using strategies that improve satiety may be a better strategy than avoiding carbs for both diabetics & normal individuals alike!

A study by Struik et al. compared the effects of isocaloric very low cab (VLC) or high carb (HC) diets on measures of hunger & satiety in diabetics while being in a 500 – 1000 kcal deficit per day. The VLC diet was 14% CHO and 58% fat while the HC diet was 53% CHO and 30% fat

What happened?
After 16 weeks, both diets decreased bodyweight by about ~10.5 kg on average. However, the HC diet improved overall ratings of fullness and prospective consumption (the desire to eat in the future) compared to LC. This means that the HC group had fewer thoughts about their next meal compared to the VLC group

The authors suggest that this is may be due to increased gastric filling. Carbohydrate rich foods contain more volume than high fat foods for the same number of calories & there are some interesting mechanisms by which food volume can reduce hunger. But that will be a topic for a future post.

Moral of the story, if you personally feel more satiated on a VLC diet then it can be a tool to reduce your intake. However, there is no evidence that its better than eating calorie matched HC diet on average, even in populations that have issues with T2D

Both these exercises have been paramount in strengthening my hip post injury, as well as helping me to improve stability around my shoulders, ankles and core. ⁣
⁣
You could add them to the end of a resistance workout as ‘finishers’ or as a movement preparation - the difference being you would hit higher reps if performing as a ‘finisher’ and moderate reps, definitely low sets (maybe even just one) if only using as a movement prep. ⁣
⁣
Runners (particularly those of your new to running) there’s this misconception that you need running to get you fit, but the truth is, you need to get your body fit to run. Exercises like this (or slightly regressed variations are incredibly beneficial in prepping joints and muscles). ⁣

Anyone who tries to convince you this process is easy is likely trying to make a quick buck.

But it can be made easier.

These 3 strategies have helped me lose over 145 pounds and hundreds of clients, and I know they’ll work for you too.

~

1. Create a Calorie Range

Calorie counting ensures you’re consistently eating few enough calories to create a calorie deficit.

The keyword being consistent.

Let’s say that you work out that you need 1800 calories to lose weight, and one day you go over and hit 1950 calories.

If you believed you had to hit 1800 calories to lose weight, then eating 1950 calories would technically be off-track.

And that may lead to more overeating that day into the next. 
But here’s the thing —> 1950 calories is STILL in a deficit!

Just less of one. 

But if you set a calorie range that was 150 calories above and below 1800 calories (1650-1950), you’d still technically be on track.

And because you’d still be on track, you’d be in a better mental space to continue moving forward.

If you wanna give it a try, click the link in my bio to use my calorie range nutrition calculator.

~

2. Find Staple Meals & Foods

One of the great things about tracking is that it allows for flexibility and variety with food choices. 

But too much variety can backfire — especially if it’s taking up loads of time each day.

That’s where staple meals & foods come in.

A staple meal or food is one that: a) you enjoy, b) is easy to make, and c) helps you hit your nutrition goals. 

I recommend finding 5-10 meals or foods that fit the criteria above and making those stapes in your daily.

(Some staples for me are @Flexpromeals, eggs, crockpot chicken, rice, and shredded potatoes.)

~

3. Plan 24 Before

Making fitness a priority requires planning, and 24 Before is the strategy we use to help our clients stay one step ahead. 

And it’s a simple as taking 5-10 mins at night to plan for the next 24 hours.

When you make 24 Before a priority each day, you’ll end up staying on track more often than not. 

~

Implement these strategies will make this process easier and more enjoyable.

Getting into the sport early, he’s now spent half his life in what has been at times, a tumultuous relationship with the sport. Like Icarus he flew too close initially, burned out, and took three years completely off training and competing. As you’ll hear, while these were challenging times for Brett, they allowed him to return to the sport with a renewed, healthier perspective towards competition, ironically resulting in his most successful competitive outcomes.

⁣
The temptation may be to throw ourselves back in to exercise out of guilt from lockdown weight gain and a loss of fitness. ⁣
⁣
BUT, we know when diet culture is running the show it often leads to unsustainable habits, worse body image outcomes and therefore more guilt & shame. ⁣
⁣
So if you’re trying to adopt an intuitive approach to movement remember these tips above as we ease back in to movement and find our groove again. ⁣
⁣
Above all, don’t compare to others online or in the gym. Focus on you, your fitness levels and how your body feels. ⁣
Because this is different than how it used to be. No more punishment. No more earning & burning. Instead it’s self celebration and self care all the way 🙌🏻💜⁣

And for good reason.

Eating enough protein is important for building and maintaining muscle. 

Protein is also very satiating, which is helpful when you’re in a calorie deficit.

But here’s the problem.

The common recommendation for protein intake is 1 gram per pound of body weight. 

This might not be an issue if you’re at healthy body weight, but if you’re currently overweight, trying to hit this requirement can be incredibly difficult.

Here’s the thing...

The 1 gram/pound recommendation is based on what’s OPTIMAL for building muscle. 

Chances are, you aren’t trying to be a bodybuilder.

If you’re like most of us, you’re just wanting to lose fat, build some muscle, and feel confident in how you look & feel.

And for that, you don’t need to force down gobbles of protein every day. 

Here’s a better approach:

Instead of aiming for 1g of protein per pound of body weight, shoot for .7-1g of protein per pound of GOAL body weight.

For example, let’s say your current weight is 200 pounds, and your goal weight is 150 pounds. Instead of aiming for 200g of protein, you should aim to get 105-150g of protein per day. 

You can even take it a step further and make 105g of protein per day your minimum daily goal, meaning you can have more than 105g of protein, but you won’t eat less than that on a consistent basis.

The Bottom Line:

If you want to lose fat at build muscle, you need to make sure you’re eating enough protein each day.

But you don’t have to eat as much as you’ve been led to believe. 

If you’re able to get .7-1g of protein per pound of goal body weight, you’ll be getting plenty of protein to support your goals.

Plus, having a lower protein goal will make it much easier to actually hit your target without having to make your entire day about protein.

Here are a few questions I get asked on DMs a lot because I drink so much NOCCO it runs through my veins 😂

Q1: What is NOCCO? 
A: NOCCO is a sugar free drink with added BCAA (branched chain amino acids) and vitamins. Just one can contains some big hitters - folic acid, niacin, biotin, B6 and B12

Q2: Why do you drink NOCCO? 
A: Firstly, I don’t drink tea or coffee (apparently that makes me weird😂) so I love the caffeine hit from NOCCO, especially when Raffi tells me it’s “awake time” at 5am. Additionally, it provides me with leucine, isoleucine and valine - those are essential amino acids that are not produced naturally by the body, so they to be obtained from our diets. I’ve really noticed a difference in muscle soreness and my fatigue during training sessions since drinking NOCCO consistently

Q3:When do you drink NOCCO? 
A: Personally, I start to drink mine about 10-15 minutes before my workout and sip the rest throughout the session🍹

Q4: Whats your favourite flavour?
A: Ooooo, right now it’s Limon Del Sol but I’m partial to a Caribbean too

I always tell people to look back on how far they’ve come instead of focussing on how far they have to go. But I feel like today’s #nationaldayofreflection is a little different. Yes, we have got through a lot since the first lockdown a year ago, but we’ve also suffered a tremendous amount of loss, pain and suffering in that time. Let’s look to better days ahead but let’s not forget to the sacrifice and heartache over the last year because they’ve given us long-term, life-changing lessons. To anyone who has lost a loved one to the pandemic, I stand with you today. 

Don’t forget your minute’s silence today at 12pm and to shine a light or light a candle from your doorstep at 8pm.

I love it when memories like these pop up on my phone! Throwing back to an experience which taught me so much and helped mould me as a coach. This was a first of its kind Nike experience in Milan back in 2016. Combining Nike running and Nike training, with some insane lighting and music, they sure did it in style! It was so fun to work with a team of world class trainers and the choreographed training which taught us to expertly programme to a beat will stay with me for life.

At the time I was on such a high. We had an awesome time, but sometimes it’s only when you look back on things that you realise how epic it really was. So team, thanks for the memories! 

What are your career and training highlights?

⁣
Progress is the accumulation of small, daily choices. For me (while injured) those choices have had to include; exercising less, dialing back the jiu-jitsu and NOT SKIPPING REHAB no matter how boring or frustrating it is. ⁣
⁣
Here is a sequence I am working with at the moment to maintain strength around my hips (particularly my right hip, adductor and ankle) and build more stability in my right foot (all these stability issues occurring on the fractured tibia side). ⁣
⁣
1. Hip extension & abduction⁣
2. Isometric Adduction
3. Single Leg DL to SL Calf Raise⁣
4. Skaters Lunge to Calf Raise.⁣
⁣
The last exercise is one of my favourite strengthening (and proprioceptive improving) exercises for the feet and ankles (mine are really struggling post injury). ⁣
⁣
These exercises also double as excellent running warm ups/movement preparations (obvi provided you don’t have any pre-existing  contraindications). ⁣
⁣
For anyone struggling with a niggling injury, kind of past the ‘bed-ridden’ and/or rest phase, the JUST WANT TO TRAIN HARD BUT CAN’T phase … don’t rush it. It’s not worth it. Remember we’re in this for life, just just 8 weeks or 12 weeks or for June 21st. ⁣
⁣
Train for life (oui, oui, it’s a double entendre).⁣

- in a nutshell I think eating intuitively is great for all times in your life apart from when you need to lose body fat

- most fitness people and celebrities who preach it as a lifestyle often come from backgrounds of restriction and tracking, therefore it’s more calculated than intuitive

- fat loss dieting is like accelerating on a road, there are times the foot is down, others coasting and others slowing down. It’s not a constant state, only a protocol to reach your destination

- if you went payslip to payslip without creating debt I’d applaud your efforts and say you go ahead and spend intuitively - but if you were constantly in your overdraft I’d say it’s a smarter idea to watch your balances and give yourself a daily limit to ensure you could reach your goals

I’m someone who needs to eat 25% beyond full to be happy at a meal, calorie tracking has worked for me and thousands of my clients. 

Most my clients are in a pickle in the first place from listening to their bodies in the first place 😂 

My clients listen to me, not their bodies for the first few months of being in my academy. 

They apply knowledge and experience from there on in, not so much intuition. 

Feel free to change my mind 😂

I'm finding I'll step it up in one area but drop the ball in another. Yes, I get this is life & that's cool we can all relate. But my gosh the ball has been dropped a little too much lately. Am I alone?

What do I do when this sort of stuff starts happening?
1. I acknowledge it.
2. I whip out my “to-do” list and write absolutely everything down on the specific day that needs to be completed.
3. I go through my “calendar” and organise my and my families life.
4. I lock in all my training for the next few weeks.
5. I clean, tidy and put things away so there's no clutter.
6. I block my day out to go through all my email accounts and text messages.
7. I work on my posture, water intake & open up my windows to let in as much natural light and fresh air.
8. I take a break from TV (except Home & Away 😂) and YouTube for a few days.
9. I schedule in when I need to be in bed.
10. I nourish my body correctly.

If I am not focused, I not only fall behind, but also drop the ball, and hold onto this awful uneasy feeling that increases stress.

✅ create a calorie deficit
✅ resistance train a few times per week
✅ use moderation with your food choices
✅ stay consistent

At least not results that last.

In theory, fat loss is simple.

In practice, it’s anything but.

Just because you KNOW what to do doesn’t mean you know HOW to do it in a way that works best for YOU.

It’s not easy, but figuring out what works best for YOU is essential for losing weight and building a reality where you can confidently maintain your results.

At @leanerforlife, we make this priority numero uno.

We don’t just get your results…

We teach you strategies, methods, and tactics that keep you in control of your results forever.

We want you to maintain a normal social life.

Read this ⤵️

Even though my standard squat stance is pretty close, these ‘super’ narrow (feet together) squats provide more quad activation, you can use different squat stances in your training to maximise leg development and squat strength.

⚠️ Not everyone will initially have the range of motion and/or balance to perform this exercise, if you do try it, be sure to attempt it without weight or with just the bar to get the technique right. Squats this narrow should be performed as deep as possible, but as comfortable as possible without compromising a neutral spine.

ℹ️ Use squat shoes or wedges 

1. It helps to further increase your squat depth.
2. It helps to keep your torso upright, which increases demand on the quads

I have a whole blog post dedicated to training during Ramadan, but I just wanted to focus on one question I get asked a lot. Muscle mass. How do you prevent yourself from losing muscle while fasting from Ramadan?

The holy month is just not the time to embark on a new fitness journey if your goal is to bulk up, because that’s a very hard task indeed with fasting such long hours (approx 18 hours in the UK!!) The focus, if strength and muscle matters to you, will be on maintenance. People often welcome weight loss during Ramadan because of the inevitable calorie deficit, but muscle loss isn’t something they want, so here are my three top tips:

1. Decrease the intensity of workouts to balance out the calorie deficit. Most people naturally enter a calorie deficit during Ramadan simply because it’s hard to consume what you normally would in the smaller window you have. This will begin to eat into muscle mass if you’re training as hard as you do normally. So decrease the intensity - lower the weight, reduce the reps and increase rest time. I’d say 20-25% reduction in intensity is about right. And consider halving the time of your normal training sessions, or doing less sessions than you would normally.

2. Don’t waste your refuel time. When you have broken fast, use that time wisely. Avoid the junk food and focus on protein which takes longer for your body to break down and will help with muscle maintenance. Lean meats like turkey as well as fish and plant based proteins such as chickpeas and beans are a great choice. If you’re really struggling to fit in your protein intake, protein shakes are a good idea for suhoor but I’d bulk them out with goodness such as spinach, oats, fruit and nut butter so that you’re ticking all the nutrition boxes.

3. Don’t carb dodge and drink that H2O. If you want to keep strength training to help maintain your strength, you really need those carbs for energy. Your training won’t be sustainable without them so add brown rice, oats, wholegrains, sweet potatoes etc to the shopping list. And if you aren’t getting enough water in when you can, then it’s game over. Water is life!!!

Losing weight is challenging in practice for a bunch of reasons:

✅ You’ve built a lifestyle/habits that support weight gain

✅Our society is quite sedentary

✅ Hyperpalatable food is everywhere

✅ You’ve used food as a main tool to cope with emotions.

✅ You’re unclear how exactly to do it because everywhere you read someone is telling you something different.

I spent 2 decades losing and gaining the same pounds over and over growing ever more confused and ever heavier until I was 41.

When I realized the answer lies in figuring out practically how to make “moving more & eating less” fit into my life as well as adding in dedicated strength training you could have knocked me over with a feather.

You mean Dr. Oz wasn’t bringing me the answer from a rain forest somewhere 🤯😵

You can work through all of those things above. Without a doubt you can. The first step is giving up the idea that it will be easy. You will need to fundamentally change your habits.

Whether you are an early bird or a night owl, training early will decrease power output due to your circadian rhythms, ingesting caffeine can “combat” this, allowing you to train in the morning with no ill effects. Finally, research conducted at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada found that caffeine supplementation could ‘permit an athletes to train at a greater power output and/or to train longer by producing a more favourable ionic environment within the active muscle” 🔱",ormSmart www.phd.com wwW PhD NUTRITION #Pe phd com,508889401,PhD Nutrition,0.59,0.59,-3.83

I have my own opinion too.

We could get into the weeds of nutrition science and research too... 

But at what cost? 

Arguing super-duper specific differences in views won’t help you, me, or anyone else reading this who’s wanting to get lean, healthy, and happy.

There’s more to being healthy than eating healthy.

What I mean is this... 

WHAT you eat is important.

But what’s equally as important is HOW YOU THINK about what you eat.

(I’d even argue it’s even more important.)

You *could* eliminate & restrict all “bad” foods from your diet and only eat foods you deem as being “good.”

But what does that do for your mental well-being?

Does it create peace OR does that restriction cause unnecessary stress in your day-to-day life? 

Does it empower you OR does it isolate you from everyone and everything around you?

Does it make you happy OR does it keep you from enjoying your life?

~

I’m not here to argue against the importance of eating whole, nutrient-dense foods.

Most of the time, you should be staying away from large quantities of highly processed junk foods. 

But if you’re at your nephew’s birthday party and he brings you a slice of cake, eat the freaking cake.

If you’re on a date with your significant other at a fancy-pants restaurant, eat what the chef recommends and finish the bottle. 

BEING healthy is about so much more than EATING healthy 100% of the time.

Your training doesn’t always have to be an epic, gargantuan, soul depleting workout … it can be small bouts of strenuous work throughout the day. This sequence is perfect post run, cycle, swim or zoom meetings that could have been emails.

Chances are you have.

And while losing 1-2 pounds per week will make sense for some people, it won’t make sense for everyone.

Let’s take two different people — Billy & Sally (our example dieters)

Billy’s 6’2, weighs 280 pounds, and wants to get down to 220 pounds.

Sally’s 5’3, weighs 145 pounds, and wants to get back to her comfortable weight of 130 pounds.

For Billy, losing 1-2 pounds per week is great progress.

But if Billy is following his plan consistently, he will likely end up losing more than 1-2 pounds per week, especially in the early stages of his journey.

On the other hand, for Sally to lose 1-2 pounds every single week, she would have to go the extremes with her diet and exercise to even come close to that recommendation.

As you can see, the “lose 1-2 pounds per week” recommendation is flawed once you take into account people’s unique situations.

For Billy, it’s a conservative.

For Sally, it’s unrealistic. 

The better recommendation is to aim to lose 0.5-1% of your total body weight per week.

This gives you a weekly weight loss recommendation based on your current weight that will adjust as your weight goes down.

The closer you get to your goal weight, the less weight loss you should expect to see each week, and this percentage-based recommendation accounts for that. 

Using the new recommendation, Billy should expect to lose 1.4-2.8 pounds per week.

(Since Billy has a lot of weight to lose, he could likely lose up to 1.5% of his body weight each week in the beginning)

Sally’s new weekly weight loss recommendation would end up being around .7-1.4 pounds per week, which is much more realistic and sustainable. 

~

Losing 1-2 pounds per week might work for some people, but it ends up being too aggressive or even a bit conservative depending on the person in question. 

A more realistic and individualized recommendation for weight loss is to aim to lose .5-1% of your body weight per week.

(Or 0.5-1.5% for folks who have a lot of weight to lose.)

👉The first thing to look at is your meals. Are you eating enough? I know you think you’re doing yourself a favor eating a puny piece of plain chicken and some dry leaves. It’s a false victory to get in as few calories as possible though. You’re likely to never be satisfied. Not to mention the actual physical hunger that will return quickly. Get in enough calories, a decent amount of protein (25-50g) some fiber, and a bit of dietary fat. That’s a meal that’ll stick✨

👉 Next let’s tackle your environment. Why are you sabotaging yourself with snacks in your desk? You’re not a toddler and you don’t need to eat every 2 hours. Trust that you’ll be ok if you get hungry. Hunger isn’t something that has to be avoided at all costs. You had a nice big meal, remember? You have another nice big meal planned. If you’re going more than 5 hours between those meals, sure plan a snack. Keep it single serving size.

👉 If you find the urge to snack coming and you’re not actually hungry, try taking a break. An actual, step away from work break. Go for a walk, stretch, close your eyes for a few minutes, get outside for some fresh air, talk to a coworker or pet your dog.

Snacks aren’t bad and there’s  no one correct meal frequency. Snacking only becomes an issue if it’s keeping you from seeing the progress you want (in other words you’re eating too many calories.)

Give these strategies a go & let me know how it works.

Granted you can do that with any workout however I do think some workouts feel better at releasing pent up frustration over others; I certainly don’t find a bi’s and tris workout as cathartic as a full body interval sequence like this one. ⁣

Anna, I love how you have stayed committed to your fitness journey. It's not always easy to create new habits or put your health first. Finding the time and energy to dedicate to exercise can be a challenge. 

My top tip for getting results when working out at home is to be CONSISTENT with your training. Once you start to create a fitness habit, you can then learn how to continue to build strength and step up your training results. Anna I'm so proud of you! 💪

Anna says: ""I just wanted to show you, that if you really commit and stick to it, you WILL see results! Those were the first 11 and 19 weeks of my journey!
Workouts + nutrition! GO GO GO!!! 🤩🥳""

Some have speculating that low carb diets may enhance exercise performance due to people becoming fat adapted & better at using fat for fuel

In ultra endurance athletes this appears to be fine, but once you get above 70% of a VO2 Max we start to see significant performance decrements on low carb diets.

During high intensity exercise we see even greater impairments in exercise performance from low carb diets, likely due to decreased glycogen availability in muscle. While muscle can use fat for fuel at low intensities (aerobic exercise) it is unable to use fat during high intensity (anaerobic) exercise. Thus, when glycogen is limited, less glucose is available for anaerobic metabolism & performance is impaired. 

When it comes to muscle gain, there is some evidence from Vargas et al that men who resistance trained while on a low carb diet gained LESS muscle and strength than those who at the same calories and protein on a higher carb diet. While carbohydrates do not stimulate protein synthesis they do decrease muscle protein breakdown & this may explain the differences observed in these studies as well as possible differences in exercise performance making it more difficult to create progressive overload in the low carb group. 

In this video I break it all down 😬",& BIOL MUSCLE GAIN ON LOW-CARB DIET,,,0.52,0.52,1.14

Jumping around to Sean T or a youtube video is exercising, it’s just getting a sweat on where a million people can do the same programme and that’s no problem if you’re desperate.

But training is following a system of which your reps and sets are just one of many moving cogs which inch towards a goal. 

Although getting more high knees and mountain climbers do count as “progressive overload” not many clients have come up to me over the years with those as their goals. 

“James, my mountain climbers need work.”

You can train at home with no equipment but you’re very limited. From a TRAINING perspective I’d always recommend a suspension trainer where all you need is a strong tree or a door frame. 

As a coach, when you have that, I can programme suitable push exercises, pull exercises, core exercises and even isolation exercises on the triceps and biceps. 

When you can bring those together in a fashion that lines up with a goal you can work towards it.

For instance most women get an insane buzz from doing push ups without their knees down and progressing to their first chin up a lot more than they get a buzz from doing 30 burpees in a minute. 

At home your main resistance you’re using is gravity, with something as simple as a suspension trainer you can make gravity your bitch across so many dimensions. 

From there you may add a band, a free weight, a bench and before you know it... you’re a fitness wanker. 

Sorry to say it, but youtube workouts can suck a fat one. I like my clientele to train at home. 

Not. Just. Exercise.

If you want to use your time back wisely, then prepare your sessions before you go in. Know what you want to achieve and how you’re going to achieve it. If that all sounds like a bit of a headache, sign up for my online strength classes on youtube and you can you workout alongside me and our Live PMA community. 

Weekly membership gives you access to 4 x 50 minute strength classes. Each class is expertly programmed and structured to get you results. Weights (dumbbells or kettlebells) are required for each class, except for the last class of the week which is bodyweight HIIT and mobility.

Do each class live alongside me at 8am Monday to Thursday or access them at your own convenience any time before Sunday night. Alternatively, if you want to get REALLY sweaty and you’re chasing that calorie burn, my Inferno classes run live on Zoom every Saturday at 9am. They’re the hardest classes I do so bring your A-game and don’t expect much recovery time!! Weights are required.

Here’s what to do instead:

1️⃣ Instead of always lifting the same weight for the same reps prioritize progression. Pick up a heavier weight or do more reps with the same weight. You want to be working close to failure (not just stopping because you get to the end of the number of reps on your training plan.) Your last reps should be *hard.* As in you couldn’t lift it again more than 1, maybe 2, times.

2️⃣ Instead of trying to burn as many calories as possible during your lifting sessions by turning everything into a giant circuit, by skimping on your rest time or spending your rest time doing cardio, slow down. Take rest times. 2-3 minutes if you’re lifting in the 1-5 rep range. 60 seconds if you’re lifting in the 6-12 rep range. 45-60 seconds in the 12+ rep range. Spend your training focusing on getting stronger.

3️⃣ Complicated isn’t better. In fact it’s usually not.  You don’t need to string a bunch of exercises together. You’ll see this a lot on social media posts of “trainers” who don’t actually have the experience or education to be training anyone. They’ll put together weird exercise combos. News flash: you shouldn’t be able to curl the same weight you’re squatting.

4️⃣ Stop skipping rest day.  You are not helping yourself training every day. Take a Minimum of 1 rest day a week (most of my clients train 3-4x per week.)

5️⃣ Stop chasing soreness. Soreness does not = a good training session. You will get sore sometimes. But you don’t need to be sore to get results,  and if you’re *always* sore you need to  take a look at your total training volume and your recovery.  Chase getting stronger not getting sore💪

Ok, what’d I miss? What’re some training mistakes you’ve made in the past?

If your arms are roasted after Lat Pulldowns, you’re doing them wrong. Your arms are a lever for your lats. 

Don’t let your thoracic spine arch excessively during the movement as well. Think about your body remaining vertical and controlling the weight with your lats. Yes, you can have a subtle arch but nothing excessive.

My family and I love to make lots of different salads for dinners and I love that Arna is exposed to so many fresh ingredients at a young age. I like to experiment with different proteins and lately have been enjoying eating more fish and shellfish and trying new ways to cook with it. This is a great way to create something with veggies you have in your fridge and is quick and easy to throw together. My one tip when using fresh ingredients and making salads is to try to use plenty of lemon juice and fresh herbs if you have them, they make a huge difference!

A new study examined social media characteristics of those who want to lose weight and those who have actually been successful with weight loss. Interestingly, the study found that people who are wishing to pursue weight loss were less likely to follow people who were thin, while people who were actually successful with weight loss were MORE likely to follow people who were thin. I discuss these results, what they mean, and the practical implications of them.

There’s working hard, then there’s working harder and THEN there’s working your hardest. Be honest with yourself even if you’re not being honest with me as your trainer! Are you turning up, consistently, and giving it your all, week in and week out? Are you as committed when you’re tired, when it’s cold outside, when you’re busy? On the days where you’re just not feeling it, are you turning up anyway because how much you want it overrides everything else? Well, are you?!

I look back sometimes and cringe beyond belief at how insecure I was and how silly I looked. But to be honest, I think that insecurity should be normalized too. Because we all have our own hang ups and that’s alright!

I am so proud that I’ve reached a point where I am comfortable with posting normal photos. Photos on the right should be normalized. Who the hell walks around with their abs popping 24/7? I certainly don’t.

I also want to take this moment to normalize weight fluctuations. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve had more weight fluctuations than I can count. Some due to health issues.. others due to stress/anxiety/depression and simply sometimes falling off the wagon.

Don’t let anyone guilt you into not having the ideal summer beach body that society conjured up. Not me, not anyone on this app, or real life!

Whilst you can grow your muscles and target specific areas to improve, as these muscles grow, they will form a specific shape. With years of training, some will develop that upper chest ledge you can rest a shaker on and some never will 😅. 

With all the upper chest work I’ve done over years (even at one point only hitting upper chest for at least a year) I’ve always been lower chest dominant. 
I suspect the reason could be either be the huge amount of dips I used to perform in my early years of training (search YouTube and you’ll find a video from 9yrs ago of me dipping with 220lbs 100kg between my legs, I did this often 😅) or the biomechanics of my long arms not being optimal for hitting upper chest 🤷🏾‍♂️

Regardless of all that I am very satisfied with my development, just thought it would be interesting to share 💪🏾👊🏾

I want to thank my friend the honorable @rob.wilkins.359 for stopping by to visit me at his home gym @theshopgym while I was visiting Virginia over the weekend and for naming me a Sports Ambassador!  If you don’t know who he is, he’s one of only a handful of people on the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition!  I’m honored to be recognized by him in his position.

In 12 days, join my buddy, former Mr. Olympia (2019), @brandon__curry, and me in recognizing National Physical Fitness & Sports Month (NPFSM), the ideal time to highlight the positive benefits of a healthy lifestyle & encourage family & friends to exercise & be physically active!

This past weekend, Brandon was in Northern Virginia promoting his new supplement line, @o15nutrition. While in town, he stopped by my gym, @theshopgym (Ashburn, VA), for a workout and meet & greet with fans and supporters. 

During his visit, I presented Brandon my President’s Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition coin for his work around the world in promoting the benefits of exercise, especially strength training. 

I also recognized him for his efforts related to inspiring and encouraging youth to reach their full potential, on the playing field and in the class room. 

Brandon and his wife, @bleaver808 are extremely proud of their connection to the United States Military as members of both their families have served our great nation. 

In appreciation for military personnel and to show their support to the upcoming @armedforcesnationals (Nov 20th, Alexandria, VA), they’re donating product to the competitors! 

Thank you, Brandy and Brandon, for your generosity and support to the troops! Keep well and look forward to seeing you both at the 2021 @mrolympiallc!

As an incredibly practical, not at all woo-woo coach I’ll tell you it’s incredibly practical.

Focusing on your eating experience allows you to notice your hunger, satisfaction, and fullness in a way that is simply not possible if you are mentally elsewhere.

This allows you to manage total calories without counting them for weight loss & eventually weight maintenance.

Swipe through the slides to find 5 specific mindful eating strategies to begin practicing.

Let me know which one you’ll focus on first!

Here are a few tips that can help ensure you're getting the most from this exercise. 

❌Not pulling high enough and pulling too much weight. Most people ‘can’ perform full range, however, they tend to load it up which can affect their range. Lower the load and complete effective reps. You don't have to be an ‘upright row hero’ to get great results! 

❌Pulling too high. Yes, confusing right? Pull to where it is comfortable, avoiding any shoulder, elbow & wrist discomfort. So only go as high as you can safely. 

❌Uncontrolled descent. It's common for the concentric movement to be performed correctly but not control the eccentric AT ALL, letting the weight drop by gravities force.

❌Forward weight. Keeping the weight centred to the body not only allows for heavier lifts it targets your side delts more. So focus on keeping the weight flush to the body and elbows going up and not forward.

❌Dump the dancing. Keep to a strict technique and work the targeted muscles. (traps, side delts, all the muscles of the upper body). No legs & no swinging!!! 

LASTLY, you don't have to do Upright rows if you don't like them. Lots of people don't do them and have strong side delts and traps. There are SO many different side delt & trap exercises. Still, give upright rows a chance and play with the technique to see if you can get them to work for you. But if at the end of the day all they do is mess up your joints, too easy don't do them.",Head & Neck Pushed Forward FIERCE Chontel Duncan Û,,,0.4,0.4,1.15

You might give push back to things you see online about the importance of a positive body image because you’re focused on “fixing” your physique from a competitive perspective. Thus, these can seem like contradictory concepts, but they don’t have to be. You don’t have to view yourself as defective or unworthy to improve as an athlete, whether we’re talking about throwing a fastball or getting bigger biceps. It might just be a matter of reframing. 

But on the other hand, maybe you really do have some negative thoughts and perceptions about your body that you don’t want to acknowledge. Maybe you make excuses for those thoughts and perceptions because you compete thinking “it’s just part of bodybuilding”? 

Wherever you are, I’d encourage you to head over to @team3dmj to read our new blog by our always awesome Mental Health Consultant Amanda Rizo MS, LPCC @rizo_amanda_marissa to learn just what positive body image is, what it means, and how it can fit in with competitive physique goals.",NEW ARTICLE WHAT IS POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND HOW DO WE CULTIVATE IT?

The greater trochanter is the top portion of your femur and this tends to protrude outward from upper your thighs, forming a “dip” between the two landmarks-see my dips?

I remember hating my body once upon a time. I sat around making a list of every surgery that I wanted: a breast augmentation, nose job, lipo, Brazilian butt lift-you name it. Luckily I only went through with one of those and had my implants removed 7 years later.

We can be so hard on ourselves and allow social expectations to poison our minds. The cellulite sometimes does still bother me, but not as much as it used to. I’ve realized no matter how lean I get, I’ll still have some. But I’ve accepted that.

We can be our own worst enemies... if we allow ourselves to be. Our minds control so much. If you change your thinking, you change your life.",,,,0.38,0.38,-1.17

The hustle never stops and hard work never fails. The second you think you’re done, you are, because success is never owned, it’s rented. And the rent is due EVERY day. There’s always another goal, another achievement or another challenge to chase. We aren’t just committed to the hustle. We live and breathe it and we refuse to reach a point on our fitness journeys where we say, “We are good enough now. Let’s leave it there.” So the question is....what is your next challenge?!

When I was 15, I was suspended for knocking a kid out who was talking shit AND got arrested (again) for theft. After seeing how much pain I was causing my mom at an already difficult time in our lives (pay check to pay check), I decided this was my last arrest and I needed to straighten my shit out - because I didn’t want to be a source of disappointment anymore for my mom. 

I did. 

But I have her to thank for the motivation & faith. 
And love.

Me and my mum show you what makes my low Impact program different from my other high intensity programs.
I asked my mum to help show you some of the exercises you'll find in my new Low Impact program when compared to higher intensity moves that you may be used to seeing me do. 

Both variations of these exercises will work similar muscles, the Low Impact version is easier on your joints and is less stressful on your body. What I love about all the exercises in my Low Impact program is that they can be done completely at your own speed. My top tip when starting out is to take your time to learn the correct technique with all of these moves instead of focusing on quantity. We aim for quality over quantity in Low Impact!

I'm doing HIGH INTENSITY: 
✅ Pop Squat & Twist
✅ Jump Lunge
✅ Mountain Climber
✅ Plank Jack
✅ High Knees

My mum is nailing LOW INTENSITY VARIATIONS: 💪
✅ Squat & Rotation
✅ Reverse Lunge
✅ Mountain Climber (Slow)
✅ In & Out Plank
✅ Standing Oblique Crunch

These are just some of the low impact exercises you'll find in my new Low Impact program - you can try it for yourself FREE for 7-days if you don't already have @Sweat. Just download @Sweat via the link in my bio to give it a try today and take the first step toward making healthy lifestyle changes.

⁣
I would brush things under the carpet when I felt under pressure and would tell myself to get on with it, despite not being in the right frame of mind. I didn’t know the importance of switching off, setting goals and putting thought through plans in place. I simply thought I would be fine. ⁣
⁣
27 now with my more experience under my belt I know how important it is to have a fit healthy mind to succeed but most importantly enjoy the journey.⁣
⁣
I learnt I had to visualise what I wanted to achieve. I had to set out a plan seeking the advise from people who wanted to see me succeed, who wanted to help me grow. (Who do you surround yourself with?) ⁣
⁣
I also learnt I had to put my own interests first and had to say no to social peer pressure. Putting myself and health first is more than ok. I’m no ‘yes’ man like I once would have been. ⁣
⁣
Learning to switch off, finding my form of meditation that allows me to calm my mind and reflect on my current situation, allowing me to deal with stress and any anxiety I was experiencing. ⁣
⁣
Walking @man.like.roots, a tough workout or 20 minutes in the steam room. Phone, WhatsApp, Instagram, emails far away from sight does it for me. ⁣
⁣
We will all fail at some point, so how we cope will determine whether we succeed or not. Beating ourselves up won’t help so ⁣
we must learn to pause and reflect. ⁣
⁣
So being mentally fit is so important!! ↙️⁣
⁣
1. Eating healthy ⁣
2. Sleeping well ⁣
3. Exercising regularly ⁣
4. Surrounding yourself with positive people ⁣
5. Setting yourself goals/targets ⁣
6. Being able to say no (social peer pressure) ⁣
7. Meditation - calming your brain/anxiety/stress levels. ⁣
8. Have things to look forward to. ⁣
⁣
I’ve recently set myself a goal to improve my core strength so here’s a workout I completed yesterday 💪🏼⁣
⁣
1. Advanced Barbell roll outs - 6 x 4sets ⁣
2. Knee roll outs - 20 x 4sets⁣
3. Weighted flutter kicks - 40 seconds ⁣
4. Weighted v ups - 10reps⁣
5. Russian twists - 20reps⁣
6. Plated knee tucks - 20reps ⁣
X 3rounds (exercises 3-6)⁣

Read that again. 

And again.

Because what’s holding you probably back isn’t your diet or exercise plan. 

It’s the story you keep telling yourself.

The story being that you are “broken” and have to be “punished” with a weight loss plan to “fix” yourself. 

☝️ That’s some bullshit. 

You are not “broken.”

You don’t need to be “punished.”

And you don’t need to be “fixed.”

~

I get it.

You’re not satisfied with where you’re at right now.

There’s nothing wrong with that. 

But if you ARE unsatisfied, then you have to choose to accept it or change it.

If you choose to accept it, then stop beating yourself up about where you’re at right now.

If you choose to change it, then you need to be ready to embrace *the suck* that comes early on while you’re just getting started.

Embrace it, learn from it, and keep going. 

With time, you’ll suck less and less, and before you know it, you’ll be one of those people who figure out the “secret” to getting results. 😉

Personally, I enjoy burpees & sprawls, call me crazy but there’s something about the way they fatigue my muscles and lungs faster than a lot of other bodyweight movements that I find satisfying. Possibly because burpees are a full-body workout that you gain strength in the entire body. (Arms, chest, quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings and core)

Burpees/Sprawls 
👉🏾 Fatigue your muscles fast
👉🏾 Quickly improve strength & conditioning
👉🏾 Require no equipment 
👉🏾 Require very little space

Landing on the ball of your feet is a common mistake made, my advice is to slow it down. Perfect your form and when you’re feeling confident, increase speed & go hard. 
While I know society has slapped a label on burpees like a form of punishment, they honestly are the complete opposite.
They are dynamic and fast-paced and can be a great addition to any training session. The rapid flexion and extension of the hips make them awesome for learning force production from core to extremity.",,,,0.32,0.32,-1.05

Did you know that booty bands work great for healing diastasis recti?

These are the three most simplest moves for healing DR. 🙌🏽 This workout is not only Diastasis Recti safe, but it’s made to actual HEAL it.

Diastasis Recti is a condition in which both halves of your abdominal muscles split open due to pressure of the growing baby. This allows for your organs to protrude through forming a tummy bundle or pooch. It doesn’t happen to all women, but for some.

These moves are also good for strengthening the pelvic floor & your Tranverse Abdominals. You have to rebuild your core from the inside out after pregnancy and avoid moves that could worsen your DA.

The transverse abdominis, also known as the TVA muscle, is the deepest innermost layer of all abdominal muscles and is located underneath your rectus abdominis. Think of it as the “corset” of your body. During pregnancy, the pelvic floor and TA keep your belly from dropping to your toes. The TA and PF, together with the uterus, work to push your baby out during delivery.
-
Moves to avoid for Diastasis Recti:
Front Plank
Twisting moves such as a Russian Twist
Crunches
Sit ups
-
How to check for DR:
Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor
Place your fingers with the palm facing you on your belly button
Lift your head and neck just slightly off the floor while you press down with your fingers. If there is a gap, that is the diastasis
Conduct the same test just above your belly button and just below the belly button.

How to do the moves:
Complete each move slowly and controlled while focusing on belly breathing.
Aim for 20 reps per move, 3 times.

I face planted the floor so many times I lost count. It was just SO hard for me to get my head around, how could everyone make these look so easy??
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Fast forward 3+ years later and they are a staple in my routine. I had a goal, showed up and stayed focused on achieving it. Staying focused on my goals for me means not shying away from challenges. It’s not supposed to be easy, you’re not supposed to know how to do it yet — if you did, it wouldn’t be a goal.
 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My biggest advice for staying focused on your goals is to break them down, start small. I started just trying to get 1 from my knees, that then became 2, 3, 4 then I moved to my toes and started all over again. Break it down, keep showing up & keep reminding yourself why you’re doing it when your mind doubts you 🙌🏻 What’s one of your big goals right now?? #TheOnlyWayIsThrough",,296981513,Under Armour Women,0.31,0.31,-1.94

I joined @nunez3dmj and @3dmjcoach to discuss how to navigate the overwhelming amount of books, podcasts, and research papers on all of the various health and fitness topics. Getting overwhelmed by information these days is pretty much unavoidable. It’s great how available good info is these days, but it’s lost amongst mountains of less than good info. Also, knowing how to apply and interpret even good info, is challenging. As a content creator I often find my meaning doesn’t come across perfectly to everyone, and may not always have the needed context for everyone to be able to apply it. 

Given these challenges we answer the following questions: what is our advice when it comes to content consumption? How is consuming content different if you’re an athlete vs. if you’re a coach? What filters and processes do we use to cut through the noise of the internet? What are some of the most common mistakes we see when it comes to content consumption? What does, “Principles move slow, strategies move fast” mean?

The answers to these, plus many related questions are covered in this episode. Head over to the @team3dmj team page and click our bio link to listen

Repost from @bleaver808
•
This video pretty much captures Zoeys heart. Most people don’t know that she aspires to be a pro level coach someday, and at the moment her heart is with coaching these kids!  She puts in any extra time that she has away from her studies and her own soccer career to work with and develop the kids. 

Most don’t know that at just 16, she has been invited to go overseas to play professionally in Europe. But we declined the offer to not lose her eligibility to play in college to be able to pursue her dream of being a coach someday as certain coaching certifications require you to have a college degree. It wasn’t an easy decision to make because of course a part of her dream is play professionally but we figured that she will only continue to get better from here. And to have the opportunity for one dream to come true right before you can be tempting. But with lots of prayer and advise from people who want to see her succeed long term, she made her decision. She has a lifetime ahead of her but I’m so glad to see that she has her head on straight. 

We love and fully support you Zoey!!!! Keep your standards high!

Anyone who's trained with me knows how much I LOVE strengthening the gluteus medius, or ""side butt"" as i like to call it. 🍑 Not only does this muscle have a huge responsibility in stabilizing the hips but a weak glute med can contribute greatly to knee and ankle injuries and can make activities like running or dancing really painful.

Here's the truth, the gluteus maximus gets most of the attention. Maybe because it's shape is more visible. But if you want to develop big, round aesthetic looking glutes then you need to include some gluteus medius exercises in your routine. It's a must!

So many of you in the #SweatCommunity ask me for low impact alternatives to the exercises in @Sweat. 

Even if you’re not doing high impact training, you can still build your strength and fitness with low impact workouts that are more gentle on your body and your joints. 

One of the best low impact exercises to build your lower body strength are lunges. I love lunges because they can be done absolutely anywhere you have space to move, they require no equipment and they are perfect for any experience level.

HOWEVER this is one of the exercises that I have found that people do incorrectly and by doing this, they start to dislike it because their form is off and it starts to hurt in places when it shouldn't. When doing lunges, it's SO important to take the time to get confident with your form so that you're using the right muscles and getting a more effective and enjoyable workout! When you master your lunges, you'll not only strengthen you back, legs and hips, you'll also improve your mobility and stability! 💪 

Here are my top tips for nailing your lunge form, to get the most of out of your next lower body workout:

👉Make sure you don’t place your back foot directly behind your front foot. Plant both feet on the floor in a split stance with your left leg forward and your right leg back, ensuring that your feet are shoulder-width apart. This is your starting position.

👉Inhale. Bend both knees to approximately 90 degrees. If done correctly, your front knee should be aligned with your ankle and your back knee should be hovering just off the floor.

👉Exhale. Extend both knees to return to the starting position. Complete half of the specified number of repetitions on the same side, before completing the remaining repetitions on the other side.

Will you be trying my tips to improve your form next time you do lunges? Tell me in the comments below. 👇

If you're ready to build your strength and fitness with more workouts you can do anytime, anywhere - ZERO equipment required -  download or update @Sweat today!

My mum always thought my programs were too hard and fast for her and her friends. It's one of the reasons I created my new Low Impact program. The program is for my mum and for ALL WOMEN like her, who don't want high intensity workouts that are fast and have jumping in them.

I designed Low Impact to have absolutely no jumping moves and to keep your whole body supported or at least one foot on the floor for most exercises.

So I invited mum over to my house to film some Low Impact workouts together and for her to really get to know the program. It was so much fun to train with her properly for the first time.

In this video we both did a Full Body Low Impact workout. As you can see in Low Impact we use time rather than number of reps in a workout. This means you can go at your own pace and focus on building up your strength over time.

✅Squat - 30 secs
✅Curl & Press - 30 secs
👉3 laps

✅Chest Press - 30 secs
✅Glute Bridge - 30 secs
✅Alternating Toe Tap - 30 secs
👉3 laps

I'm so proud of how well she did today in front of the cameras too.

#SweatCommunity! Have any of you worked out with your mum, aunty or grandma before? Let me know in the comments or post a story with you all working out together. 💪

The sun has a way of showing our skin’s true texture/color/scars/dimples/you name it! Most influencers take their photos indoors and not in direct sunlight for this very reason. Don’t feel ashamed! Wear are the shorts and wear them proudly. Don’t waste the rest your life covering up what you perceive to be flaws. I promise you, it’s likely that nobody is noticing what YOU notice and pick apart. At the end of the day, we are all too busy picking apart our own bodies.

I tried my best to get good footage but I also brought all 3 of the boys with me so I was often distracted while keeping an eye on them at the same time, so this was the nest I could do.

Her motive is to motivate and encourage others to focus on consistency with their nutrition & exercise.

Consistency is such a challenging factor in anyone's journey. But it is consistency during the tougher times that develop pure change. Remember next time you feel like you have no gas left in the tank, that it is this moment when you MUST continue to put one foot in front of the other to break the cycle for good.

What we want isn't easy... But I ask, how bad do you want it?

Here’s What Happened! Link in my bio}

Ahhh the juice cleanse. It’s been around for ages promising marvelous things. I read where it was supposed to help with inflammation (celery juice craze), stomach issues, and even depression! Hmmmm.

After feeling sluggish for a few months, I decided to put it to the test to see exactly what could happen and if the promises were true. After all, I make a good guinea pig! 😂

What DID happen:
I did gain more energy it seemed as my body woke itself up at 5:30 instead of 8am.
It did beat my cravings (well after day one-the first whole day I was craving the new KFC chicken sandwich)!
It did give me a better outlook on which foods to choose for my body and to become more mindful about what I eat.
It did give my body a break from all the crap I’ve been eating and drinking lately.
I did load up very good nutrients, veggies, fruits, and herbs such as turmeric, ashwagandha, milk thistle, beets, kale, and algae.

What DIDN’T happen:
I didn’t lose weight or fat (don’t ever believe these claims)!
I didn’t feel magically different.
I didn’t “detox” through a cleanse alone. The truth is that your body’s organs detoxifies themselves!

Bottom line: This is not a quick fix-there’s no known proof that cleanses actually “clean” you. The body is always cleansing itself anyway! Your best bet is sticking to a well rounded diet filled with lots of fruits, veggies, and water!

Kara says: ""Needed a little motivation today so used my own transformation to spark a fire in me. Just know that this is 3 years of my personal progress. 3 years ago I made the decision to make my health a priority. I was never perfect. I fell down but I always got back up. And most importantly I practiced balance in my lifestyle. It. Just. Takes. Time! I’m never stopping because it’s a lifestyle now.""

⁣
My mum worked at my primary school so she always KNEW that we were going to be SO hungry when we got home because we had been running around all day and hadn’t eaten for a few hours!! ⁣
⁣
So she would cut up lots of fruit and vegetables and put them on a platter with a type of homemade dip (like tzatziki or hummus) for us to snack on. We used to complain and say that we wanted things like chips, ice-cream or chocolate. And she would say “I bet you will eat this!”. And sure enough, we did. ⁣
⁣
This kind of snack would keep us full enough before dinner, but didn’t fill us up so much that we didn’t want to eat our whole meal. ⁣
⁣
For those of you who are asking about how to stop unhealthy snacking while you’re at home, this kind of thing is exactly what I would recommend. Get prepared and chop up vegetables and keep them in the fridge. Then, when you're hungry or feel like a snack, you have a healthy option that is sitting right in front of you. It will make it so much easier to make good choices. ⁣

Easter break is officially over for our household, so the two older boys are back to daycare/vacation care.

@sam_hiitstation and I love trying to change up the boy's lunches as much as we can. Trust me we have our moments where we feel like it's looking quite repetitive and lacking in variety.
That's why I loved creating this post, makes it easier to see some of the items we cycle through. (I couldn't fit everything on here)

I would LOVE to know what other healthy snacks you pack for your little ones, to spread inspiration for all the parents and guardians on my account. (and for us lol)

Obviously, I didn't include products containing nuts, especially loose mixed nuts 😳 as two of our boys are anaphylactic to nuts.
This is my biggest fear if a child was to accidentally drop some and my son curiously tried it.

The gym had always been the place where I felt in control, comfortable and strong. I felt so upset when I realised I couldn't do anything I used to be able to do. But I persisted and kept working, and eventually I've become stronger than I was before.

What I have now realised is that although this was a really difficult time, it actually allowed me to grow as a person. I was able to prove to myself that I could build my strength back and that felt amazing, I felt empowered and proud of myself. Also, being pregnant and becoming a mother gave me so much experience and I gained mental and emotional strength that I’d never had before. Now, I am even more understanding of other women's experiences and I have become so grateful for what my body can do. 

Tough times are going to make you stronger, and help you to grow. #SweatCommunity, I want you to realise the importance of your life experience. Tag someone who needs to hear this today. 💛

Susanna, I love what you have to say about the challenges and gains you've made on your fitness journey. It's not always easy to continue to commit to your health and wellbeing but once you start being consistent with creating positive lifestyle changes you will reap the rewards in so many areas of your life. 

If you're ready to prioritise your fitness journey like Susanna, my new Low Impact program is the perfect way to get started or return to fitness if you've been injured or have recently taken a break from exercise. Click on the link in my bio to start your FREE 7-day @Sweat trial and give it a try today! 

Susanna says: ""This month marks the four year anniversary of embarking on a fitness journey that would subsequently change my life.

There’s been many ups and downs and I’ve learned so much along the way. It hasn’t been easy, but the strength, confidence, and courage I’ve gained is priceless. It isn’t about a temporary quick fix, it truly is about a lifestyle change and I’m on board for LIFE!
⠀
I want to thank Kayla for helping me get started on the path to health and fitness. Her programs are an important part of this, as they have been a staple for me the last four years! ❤️It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey, and it all begins with a single step! ✨""

I'm so proud of you Susanna for putting your health and wellbeing first! It is stories like these and others from the #SweatCommunity that inspire me every single day.

Join us tomorrow as Gabrielle Fundaro facilitates a conversation with Shannon Beer, who holds a LLB from King's College London, is an MNU-Certified Nutrition Coach, and is a co-creator of Comprehensive Coaching--an iterative framework of holistic, nutritionally-agnostic, weight-impartial approach facilitating behavior change from the inside out. Paul Revelia and Dr Joe will round out the panel as they dig into the relational processes that can help you raise your game as a coach. Join us to learn how you can unlock communication to help your clients succeed.

2 cups broccoli florets
1 cup snow peas

1 cup carrots sliced into thin strips
sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

Whisk all the ingredients for the sauce in a medium bowl.Place salmon in a large ziplock bag or large bowl. Pour sauce over salmon and marinate in the fridge for 15 minutes or up to 24 hours.

2. Transfer salmon to baking sheet. Reserve the marinade that is left in the bag. Add broccoli, snow peas, bell pepper and carrot to the pan. Spoon a few teaspoons of the marinade oven veggies and drizzle with a teaspoon oil.

3..Bake at 400 for 15 minutes or until salmon is flaky and cooked through, bake times may vary by thickness of salmon.
While salmon is baking, transfer remaining marinade to a small sauce pan and bring to a boil then reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened (2-3).

4. Remove salmon and veggies from the oven and brush remaining sauce on salmon fillets. Top with a sprinkle of sesame seeds if desired. Serve with rice, noodles, salad, or alone. Enjoy!

This is a popular question for busy people who struggle to find time to prep and cook fresh produce on a daily. 
Now the way that you cook frozen vegetables CAN affect their nutrient content, BUT this is also the case with fresh produce. 🤔

What you need to look out for is whether the frozen vegetables that you are buying contain any added sugar, salt, or premade sauces and seasonings.

Frozen vegetables are a convenient addition to a balanced diet & I personal LOVE them and use them for both myself and my children.

So what is best?
Picking fresh veggies from your own veggie garden has to be the optimal situation. But (in Australia), veggies
often travel a very long distance to get to us. (this can be several days)
We know that the longer it takes to get fresh food to us from the farm, the more nutrients (in the food) slowly decrease.

I'm not saying fresh fruit and veg is not a good choice. But frozen vegetables are certainly a valid option.","Frozen Vegetables Benefits Last longer than fresh vegetables BIRDSEY SteamFresh Pexs.Beans.ComBroccolMix 3sambg Gives access to produce that isn't currently in season Easy way to meet nutrition needs Freezing prevents nutrients from being lost as the food ripens Affordable Perfect addition to stir- frys, stews, curries, soups, and casseroles to increase volume and stay fuller for longer!

TODAY IS YOUR DAY ONE 
For anyone who has taken a break from fitness, I know how hard it can be to start again. Potentially even more daunting or scary is taking that very first step. Starting to make a change and doing your first ever workout or exercise. One thing I want everyone to know and remember is that most people have been there too. Right where you are now. Every single person in your gym, everyone you admire in the fitness industry, even the trainers you follow on IG, the women in your workout classes or in your network have had their own DAY ONE! 

If you feel like starting to exercise or working out for the first time feels like a big mountain to climb, then I'm here to tell you that it doesn't need to be that hard. Taking just small steps to begin with is all you need. Try to attempt things that are manageable and are on your own level. Try moving more throughout your working day or try swapping a car ride for a short walk. 

My main advice is DON'T compare yourself to others, don't try to jump ahead too quickly. Go at your own pace with any exercise you do. I've created a brand new program that is perfect for this exact moment. If any women out there are reading this and don't know how or where to begin, then my Low Impact program has got you! The program is low intensity, meaning no jumping or explosive moves you might see a lot on Instagram. We take it slow with this program but you will still be able to build up your fitness level, just at your own pace. We always have a FREE 7-day @Sweat trial available for anyone wanting to take that first step and now my Low Impact program, which is my most accessible program ever, is here to get you moving. So today could be your DAY ONE and don't worry it will won't be day one for very long!

We all know that I absolutely LOVE this type of meal (gyro in Greek) and because it's so quick and easy to make my family and I often make this for dinner. Something that I have been really enjoying and adding to my gyro or yiros lately is falafels! Not only are falafels delicious, they are actually a great source of plant-protein. If you are vegetarian or flexitarian (which means you generally have a vegetarian diet, but occasionally eat meat), these are such a good option. 🙌

You can eat them by themselves dipped in hummus or with tzatziki, or you can add them to salads or put them in a wrap like this!

They are also really easy to make at home. This is the recipe I use:

✅ 250g tinned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
✅ ½ lemon, juiced
✅ 1 small handful fresh parsley, roughly chopped
✅ 1 garlic clove, crushed
✅ ½ tsp ground cumin
✅ ½ tsp ground coriander
✅ 2 tbsp wholemeal flour
✅ Salt and pepper, to taste
✅ 1 tbsp olive oil

Put all ingredients (except for the oil) in a food processor and blend until well combined. Put the falafel mixture into a large bowl then shape the mixture into 6 falafel balls, then flatten them slightly between your hands. Cover and refrigerate the balls for 30 minutes.

Heat oil in a large non-stick fry pan over medium heat. Cook the falafels for 4-5 minutes each side or until cooked through and golden in colour. Then add them into a wrap or pita bread like this one with some greek salad. SO yummy! 😍

Hummus with pita bread!! SO delicious. 😍
This recipe is my family recipe that I LOVE and make it all the time because it’s so quick and easy. 

Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) are the main ingredient, and they are an amazing pantry staple, as they’re an excellent source of both protein and fibre. When I make my hummus it usually lasts around 5 days in the fridge, so I always make a big batch on the weekends and then my snacks are sorted for the week ahead! 🙌

Recipe:
✅ 2 x 400g cans of chickpeas ⁣(garbanzo beans)
✅ 1 tsp cayenne pepper⁣
✅ 3 tbsp lemon juice⁣
✅ 2 garlic cloves, crushed⁣
✅ 1/2 cup olive oil⁣
✅ Sprinkle of salt and pepper⁣

Depending on what flavours you like, you could also add:⁣
✅ A handful of coriander⁣
✅ 1/2 tsp chilli flakes⁣

All you need to do is throw all of the ingredients into a blender, except for the olive oil, stopping to wipe down the edges when needed. Once blended, gradually add the olive oil until the hummus is a nice consistency. And that's it! You can then add toppings like tomato, red onion and herbs too if you like.

Ana, what is so exciting to me about your fitness journey is the change you have noticed in your mindset. It can be so easy to get discouraged about exercising. When you’re busy or tired, you might feel more like sitting on the couch than taking time out of your day to get active. Ana's journey is proof that the benefits of committing to your health and fitness are not just skin deep, the changes we feel inside are the most important part of the journey! Ana, I'm SO proud of you! 👏

Ana says: ""I am a different person inside and out. All of the good bits of myself, I packed up neatly and brought along for the ride. Only the smallest suitcase was allowed to come, the heavy baggage got dropped in pieces along the way.

Goodbye insecurities. Goodbye second guesses. Goodbye doubts. Goodbye negative self talk, negative body image and terrible coping mechanisms.

There is no quick fix for all those feelings. Just like there’s no quick fix for the way we look or hope to look either. It’s a slow process of chipping away at stuff with daily work and consistency.""

Cort, your fitness journey is inspiring. I love how you've chosen to take small actions to create new fitness habits and make healthier choices. 

If you want to start making a lifestyle change that sticks like Cort, my top tip is to put in place small, sustainable changes. Start building the habits you want to create into your daily routine and try connecting them with a cue that already exists in your day to help remind you. When you’re starting out, it’s also SO important to give yourself a reward once you complete a new habit to help to reinforce it.  

If you’re ready to make a commitment to work towards a healthier lifestyle like Cort, you can start your FREE 7-day trial of my program by downloading @Sweat today.

Cort says: “We all start somewhere and this is where I did 🖤I was always an active person, I grew up being a gymnast and competing. After high school I struggled with an eating disorder. I lost a lot of weight and so many people complimented me on how great I looked. I then thought “man I must have looked terrible before so now I should lose more weight...”. Food became my enemy. Fast forward 6 months I became pregnant with Austin and that quite literally saved me. I knew I had this precious baby to nurture so I started learning how to eat to be healthy. I found how to count macros and boom my fitness journey started 🙌🏼 My friend started using @sweat with @kayla_itsines BBG (before the app was a thing) and she had amazing results and so I joined along! Little did I know I’d soon become in love with it! 🙌🏼""

She is truly his biggest fan...and I’m a HUGE fan and supporter...but there’s something so special about the way she is so passionate when it comes to her brothers and the amount of effort she puts forth into them out of her love for them...oh I cannot wait for his 11U season...his entire team is special...not just my Maximus...I just speak on behalf of mine because I’m his mother and that’s what we do...but I can assure you that his entire TEAM from coaches to players are something SPECIAL!

I know that previously there have been women out there and in the Sweat community, including my own mum, who looked at my programs and thought they were too hard or too intense.
I know some women have looked at my BBG programs and thought, 'no thanks Kayla’. That’s why I am so excited for my new Low Impact program to be available.

I know that my workouts will now be more accessible to more women who want effective, easy to follow workouts that can be done in less than 30 minutes. They can now be done at a lower intensity with no jumping and are easier on your joints.

I learnt early on in my career as a personal trainer that it isn’t just about having programs that I love to do (I still love a burpee and a lunge jump), but it's about designing programs and workouts that work for all the different women out there. It's about getting them moving and feeling good about themselves.

I’ve designed this Low Impact program so that there is absolutely no jumping and you keep your whole body supported or at least one foot in contact with the ground during most movements. We use time rather than number of reps so you can go at your own pace and still get results.

There are 3 easy to follow workouts per week with optional express workouts when you are short on time.

So if you want to try my Low Impact program, head to the link in my bio to take one of my 7-day free trials and download @Sweat to get unlimited access to my Low Impact program for a week to start you off.

If you're already a Sweat member then simply update your app to access Low Impact with Kayla now. I cannot wait to hear what you think of it.

The more you aim for progress, the more you will celebrate your wins - it might be those five extra push-ups, your first set of burpees, or just making the time to get outside and go for a walk on a really busy day.

Click the link in my bio to shop them.

Let’s get one thing straight: “hip dips” are not a flaw... yet I get asked constantly on how to get rid of them.

What are hip dips anyway? They’re the inward curves on the outer, upper thighs, just below the hip bone (scientifically called a trochanteric depression) due to a space between the hip bone and the femur (thigh bone). It’s usually most noticeable in women with higher and/or wider hip bones. 
Here’s the good news: If you have them, don’t be alarmed. It’s totally natural. The shape of your hip-to-femur joint requires no more concern or change than the shape of your knees, knuckles, or any other joint. Same thing with a thigh gap-it’s all down to your genetic structure.

How do we get rid of them? Well, you can’t target them and you can’t change your bone structure. You’ve got to find peace about this. BUT what you CAN do is build upon the muscle in this area aka the Gluteus Medius which can help *some* with appearance. However, I’m not going to bullshit you-I do not believe you can grow your muscles to completely “fill out” this space.

Here are several exercises to work the Gluteus Medius. I always say, if you can’t fix it, work it & flaunt it!

It might seem strange to anyone who's been working out for a while, but a lot of women who are new to fitness don't realise how important a warm up is before training. Making sure your muscles are warm and ready to perform at their best is ESSENTIAL and can help to prevent injury. My programs are quite high intensity and that means your muscles are moving a lot, so make sure you've warmed up your full body before any of my workouts. This cardio-based warm up will get you ready to smash any workout!

✅ Skipping or Skips
✅ High Knees
✅ Butt Kicks
✅ Criss Cross
✅ Caterpillar Walk & Half Burpee
✅ Mountain Climber
✅ Pop Squat & Twist	

Try each exercise for 40 seconds before moving to the next movement. Complete 1 lap!

LEARN HOW TO DO PUSH-UPS
Building your strength to be able to do push-ups can can take time. If you can't do push-ups yet, I always recommend that you don't go straight into them. Instead, build up your chest and wrist muscles first and make sure you know how to do them the right way to reduce your risk of getting an injury. 

It might take you a few weeks or months before you feel confident to do push-ups. Remember, it doesn't matter how quickly you're able to do an exercise, what's more important is taking it at your own pace and learning the correct technique. 

If you’re starting out on your fitness journey here are my tips if you're learning how to do push ups:

👉 Align your shoulders over your wrists
👉 Engage your core and glutes throughout movement
👉 Keep your chest lifted and press away from the floor
👉 Move as slow as necessary to maintain control
👉 Ensure elbows bend towards your feet

#SweatCommunity I've released my new Low Impact program for anyone returning to fitness or starting out for the first time. I've designed it so that you won't have to jump and it will take the stress out of your joints when you are working out. 

So give these tips for push-ups a go and if you want more low intensity exercises and workouts, give my new Low Impact program a go! 

You can start a FREE 7-day Low Impact @Sweat trial through the link in my bio today.

These crispy baked cauliflower tacos with cabbage slaw look so delicious and are super simple to make with salad ingredients and vegetables from your fridge. I love how with a few simple tricks you can turn a simple veggie like cauliflower into something special. To make cauliflower the main event in a meal like this, I like to mix it up in a bowl with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper and roast it in a really hot oven until it becomes brown and crispy on the edges. You can take it to the next level by adding some breadcrumbs to up the crunch factor!

Healthy eating can be easy and quick!

I love eating like this because it means you get to try a variety of different flavours and textures and you can use both fresh and cooked ingredients. This one uses beans and tofu but you could easily substitute your favourite protein or vegetable. 

I also love that you can eat this either as a bowl or mix it up and serve it in a taco shell or with your favourite flat bread to make a healthy wrap. 

Here's some ideas to help build a quick and easy nutritional bowl:

✅ Start with a leafy green. I like romaine lettuce or baby spinach or you could even try kale.
✅ Choose a protein that you like - why not try beans or tofu, or if you eat meat or fish choose your favourite! 
✅ Add some extra veggies like cucumbers, zucchini (courgette), snap peas, radish, green beans, broccoli or cauliflower. 
✅ Try to include some healthy fats. I like avocado, olive oil, olives and nuts for crunch. 
✅ Load in some extra flavour. I love making a homemade salad dressing with crushed garlic and olive oil. I also love to add chilli flakes and fresh lime to add some extra kick!

This test can tell you:
-if you have more or less eggs than average
-your expected success rates for IVF or egg freezing
-how your hormone levels relate to PCOS (which 1 in 10 women have)
-your general hormone health - which is a window into your broader health! It will give you insights for menopausal timing, thyroid health, and more.

I know at just 32 years old, I am still good to go, but I wanted that peace of mind knowing that I am still capable of expanding my family in the near future if I wanted to!

1 in 6 couples have trouble conceiving and 1 in 10 ladies have PCOS so its important to know where you stand.

Did you know that when we speak negatively about ourselves and others, it can spiral and grow? By gradually changing the thoughts and behaviours that are stopping you from living the life that you want, you can start to move towards a more powerful, confident version of yourself. 

Instead of saying, ""I can't"" - next time, why not try - ""I will be able to one day. It might hard but I will get there."" 

Believe that what you want to achieve is possible. The more you change your mindset and start to celebrate the small steps of progress you make along the way, the more you will develop the confidence you need.

In six months, Amy was able to lose 20 pounds and 10+ inches from her waist and hips.

Maybe people will think that losing 20 pounds in six months is slow progress, but they’d be mistaken. 

You see, Amy didn’t just lose fat…

She built lean muscle too!

The scale may show she only lost 20 pounds, but the reality is that she lost way more than 20 pounds of fat and put on multiple pounds of muscle during this process.

Another reason to remember that the scale is not the end-all-be-all of progress.

[/Quick Side Note]

SWIPE LEFT to read more about Amy’s experience as being a client and what she was able to accomplish along the way.

Oh, and fun fact…

Amy had such a  transformative experience that she went on to become a certified personal trainer and is now a coach on the @leanerforlife team!

I understand that it can be scary to begin working out if you are just starting out on your fitness journey, are a new mum, or are returning to exercise after injury. 

There's lots of different reasons why you may not want to, or be able to, complete high intensity workouts right now and I know so many of you in the #SweatCommunity have been requesting lower impact workouts. 

So, for everyone who has been asking for it, here's an upper body workout I've created just for you. This is a great workout that will build strength without putting too much pressure on your joints, and can be done anywhere, anytime. 

My top tip before doing this workout is to take the time to warm up first by stretching or even doing a few minutes of walking or other movement, to help activate your muscles before you begin exercising. 

Try this low impact workout on your next upper body day. 

✅ Shoulder Tap - 30 secs 
✅ Lay-Down Push-Up - 30 secs

Do 2 laps.

✅ Reverse Table Top - 30 secs
✅ Side Plank - 30 secs
✅ Hover Leg Extension - 30 secs

Do 2 laps.

Did you know that by simply adding in a recovery session each week, or stretching before or after your workouts, you can improve your range of motion? Increasing your range of motion will help improve circulation and increase your flexibility, which means working out will feel easier because you will be able to do each exercise with proper form (well, you'll still be working hard, haha 😜). I always try to make time to stretch on a Sunday night so I can feel refreshed and ready for a big week ahead. 

If one of your goals is to improve your range of motion, this stretching session is for you. Just remember ladies, building healthier habits does not have to be overwhelming - it can be as easy as adding a quick 5-minute stretch session into your day!

✅ 90/90 Box Hip Stretch - 60 sec (30 per side)
✅ Abs to Childs Pose - 30 sec
✅ Floor Slides - 30 sec
✅ Hip Flexor to Hamstring - 30 sec
✅ Squat With Thoracic Rotation - 30 sec 

Give this a go after your next workout or add in a recovery session and see what difference it makes. 💪 ⁣

Choosing the right weights depends on which one of my programs you're doing. I know that when you first start working out, selecting the right weights can feel intimidating. With so many different weight amounts and types - from dumbbells, to medicine balls, kettle bells and barbells - it can be confusing to know where to start.

Whether you’re wanting to build muscle, increase flexibility or grow stronger, choosing the right weights to add to your workout can help. Using weights is not only an amazing way to increase your strength, it's also great for beating stress and challenging your muscles - so they can come back stronger! 💪

So if you’ve been unsure about where to start with weights, I’ve created this guide to give you all the info you need. How to get started, when to increase your weights and, just as importantly, when to STOP increasing weight. 

For everyone who is completing one of my programs and is incorporating weights, I recommend you go lighter so you can complete more reps and build up resistance rather than only being able to complete a few reps with heavier weights.

I've added in express workouts in my new Low Impact program as I know that sometimes putting aside time for working out can be difficult if you have a busy schedule or if you are a mum. 

I really wanted to give every woman the best chance at keeping up their workout routine and being consistent. When you are starting out keeping up that consistency is super important as any pauses in your routine are hard to come back from. 

So my Low Impact express workouts are under 15 minutes and are there for you if you can't do a full workout. These may be short but they will still work you and help towards getting you stronger and healthier. 

I've created this video to show you the kinds of ab strengthening workouts you can find in my Low Impact program. You don't need any equipment, so you can do an effective workout just about anywhere.

In this video I take you through a Low Impact express abs workout.

✅ Four-Point Arm & Leg Extension - 40 secs
✅ Deadbug - 40 secs

✅ Modified Ab Bike - 20 secs
✅ Heel Taps - 20 secs

Try doing 2 laps!

So if you are ready to start your fitness journey and looking for something that is flexible and accessible then give my Low Impact program a go. Remember this program has no jumping and will go easy on your joints too.

You thought I was wearing real makeup. Well I’m back with another one to show you that you can change even more than just your facial features.

I was so inspired with @dove and their newest campaign against editing apps. They literally took a bare faced pre-teen and turned her into a grown supermodel. Don’t believe me? Go see it or checkout my stories.

Studies show 80% of Canadian girls are using photo editing apps by the age of 13. I can’t imagine the stats for USA. What are these apps teaching us? To hate our natural look and live in a fantasy world of what we only wish we could view ourselves as? When we look in the mirror, these apps leave us feeling like shit when we see our real selves. I’ve often heard women say, “I wish this filter was real life!”

I feel these apps should be banned. You don’t know what’s real these days until you see it. And even when you see it, you still don’t know thanks to cosmetic surgery.

Show this to your sons & daughters. Warn them. If I had seen this when I was 14, it would’ve prevented my eating disorder and helped to have given me better self esteem.

Marie, I'm so proud of you for pushing through and staying dedicated to building your strength and fitness! 👏 

Marie says: ""💥 Celebrating officially 1 year of quarantine, working from home, eating healthier, and @sweat! 🎉
This exact day was my last in office last year. I took my new opportunity of working remotely and decided to focus on my health. I used to be an athlete, but over the last few years found it difficult to balance working out and eating healthy.

The @sweat app changed my expectations of what working out and eating healthy can look like. Sometimes I still get upset with myself when I overindulge in treats or take a couple weeks off from working out, but then I look at all of my progress! Even though I haven’t been “perfect,” I feel so much stronger than I did a year ago. I can’t wait to continue this journey in a post-pandemic world as well 🌎""

After going through the experience of giving birth,  it can take time for women's bodies to regain strength.

After I was pregnant with Arna, I found that hip strength was a particular area that took time to rebuild before I could slowly work my way back up to higher impact exercises. This inspired me to create a workout for all the #SweatCommunity who are looking to get back into fitness after having a baby, to help gently rebuild hip strength and return to exercise with confidence. 

Pregnancy, as well as carrying around little kids all day (yes, I can relate haha!), can place extra strain and pressure on your hips. This workout has been designed to help you gradually rebuild your muscle strength before you’re ready to do higher intensity workouts.

✅ Four-Point Arm & Leg Extension - 16 reps (8 per side)
✅ Donkey Kick - 16 reps (8 per side)
✅ Fire Hydrant - 16 reps (8 per side)
✅ Glute Bridge - 20 reps
✅ Clam - 16 reps (8 per side)
✅ Hip Abduction - 16 reps (8 per side)

Try doing 2 laps - and tell me how you go in the comments. 👇

Every woman and every pregnancy is different, so make sure you speak to your healthcare professional and seek clearance before exercising after giving birth (like I did). For more post-pregnancy workouts, check out my Post-Pregnancy program on @Sweat.

We all know exercising has so many benefits, but after having a baby it can be hard to know where to start and how to regain your strength. While you may be keen to stay active post pregnancy, your body has been through some big (and amazing!) changes, so it is really important to take it slowly and gradually to rebuild your foundational fitness. 💪

After giving birth to Arna, I was genuinely shocked at the toll pregnancy had taken on my body. I felt like I couldn't put one foot forward on the treadmill, I thought my career as a personal trainer was over. A job that I LOVED... I thought I couldn't do it anymore. 

I came to realise there isn’t clear guidance for women who want to start exercising after pregnancy. So that's why I created my Post-Pregnancy program in @Sweat - for women like me who had no idea where to start. 

Here’s an upper body and core workout to give you an idea of what to expect in my Post-Pregnancy program: 

WARM UP: 
✅ Thoracic Foam Roll - 50 sec
✅ Child's Pose - 60 sec
✅ Floor Slides - 30 sec

CIRCUIT: 
✅ Bent-Over Row - 12 reps 
✅ Shoulder Press - 12 reps
✅ Bent-Over Reverse Fly - 15 reps 
✅ Hover - 30 sec 

Complete 1 lap of the warm up and 3 laps of the circuit! 

SAVE this workout and let me know how you go in the comments below! 🙌

Remember - it’s so important that you obtain clearance from your health professional after giving birth before starting any exercise program.

These are all designed to be done at your own speed and are suitable for all fitness levels - whether you're starting out, or restarting your fitness journey. I love all of these exercises because you can go as fast or as slow as you like and you will see, there's absolutely no jumping at all! 

✅ Chest Press
✅ Front & Side Raise
✅ Sumo Squat
✅ Static Lunge
✅ Bent-Leg Raise

With Low Impact there are 3 easy to follow workouts per week with optional express workouts when you are short on time. We use time rather than number of reps in any given workout or session so you can go at your own pace but you will still get results.

Ingredients:

I always encourage women who have never worked out before to begin building up your ab and glute strength because you'll start to feel a BIG difference in your daily life. Strengthening your abs and glute muscles will make day-to-day activities easier, like walking, climbing stairs, picking up your children or even just standing upright for long periods of time. A strong core can also help reduce the likelihood of experiencing lower back pain. 

Here are some of the exercises you can expect to find in my new Low Impact program to help strengthen your abs and core. To try my Low Impact program FREE for 7-days, head to the link in my bio to download @Sweat today!

Innocently I see people performing incomplete reps. While it can be simple mistakes like this one here, it’s important to understand that over a long period this all adds up to a lot of missed opportunities.

Quality over quantity is my motto!

Remember to take your time, go through the correct technique and once you feel confident increase the intensity.

-
1- Check your local gym club to see if they are running open sessions. They are more places that run them than you think it’s just a matter of finding where & the closest session to you.
2- Have a structure ie warm up, train, conditioning, stretch but have no expectations of training. You don’t want to leave disappointed & deflated, instead spend the time getting used to the environment, chatting to some new people, using the equipment, trying some skills. 
3- Talk to people! You’ll be sharing the floor or tramp or bars with other people so find out what days people train, what days are busy, what they do, how they learnt.
4- Have fun!!!! When was the last time you jumped on a trampoline or did a forward roll? Literally even if you never go back again at least your inner child had some fun.

-
Yep it’s a myth. Don’t get me wrong I am a huge advocate of incorporating hollow body drills & core exercises into handstand training because it’s an incredibly important shape needed in gymnastics skills & it’s a great way to develop body awareness so you know what the shape feels like but what’s more important for your handstand is to understand what’s going on with your upper body. 

The straight handstand you see is a result of having the shoulder flexibility to get arms to ears & the strength to elevate the shoulders during the handstand. So if you can stand with yours arms in the air , ribs down you have the ability to hold a straight handstand. If you are weaker or not flexible, the body compensates to try & help you balance & that’s where shapes like the banana or pikes can occur. The downside is our wrists are a lot less stable than our hips so it won’t be an easy journey. 

I would however also point out that you can hold a handstand & develop pretty good handstand skills without a perfect line . It’s more of an aesthetic thing so don’t get too caught up on that whilst on your journey!

Crazy start to Monday for me with classes restarting, gyms re opening & finishing off a 3 month block of sessions with @impowercreatives 🎉
-
In January i invested a lot of money into myself with new courses, mentors & honestly for the growth it’s given me it’s been totally totally worth it. 
-
I think investing money into yourself through coaches & mentors & courses can sometimes be really hard to do but I think when we hold our hands up & realise we can’t do it all ourselves & that there are people there to help us & (if you get the right person) it will be worth every single penny. 
-
I appreciate every single person that has trusted me & put their flexibility training in my hands for the month because they took the step out of the comfort zone to come & learn more about a skill they didn’t know how to develop on their own. My aim is to provide a space that keeps people accountable, connects them to a community & helps them learn how to actually get flexible as an adult. It’s exciting to see how my own growth is now helping other people too! So excited for session 2 on Thursday 💙",,,,0,0,6.83

-
Let me tell you I know how hard it is when the voice in your head starts feeding you lies & I also know how much time, pain & stress you can remove if you can stop those thoughts in their tracks early doors so here’s some tips that I’ve found help me out.
-
1- Being aware of my triggers. Even if i don’t really want to admit what sets me off because it feels silly , holding my hands up & being more self aware can help stop things getting out of control. 

2 - I imagine I’m in a court case with myself. I present myself with the actual facts. 
‘I’m a bad teacher’ well actually you have 20 plus reviews here saying how much everyone enjoyed it so that’s not the case’ 
‘Noone enjoys my content’ oop well actually you have a community of people here that felt comfortable sharing their experiences in space you created . 
‘I got a bad comment everyone hates me’ okay is it constructive criticism or is it just spiteful. If it’s constructive you are allowed to get things wrong if it’s spiteful block & delete. 

3- Removing myself from situations with instant gratification. What i don’t want is to use others to make me feel better. Because while a very good temporary fix it’s not long lasting. Instead I trying doing something solely for myself & because I enjoy it. Reading a book, walk with a friend, study, Netflix, journalling, training. 

I hope these tips help. Sending lots of ❤️",,,,0,0,8.49

So excited to be able to put on this second block of classes! If you have no idea how to approach flexibility training as an adult & are struggling to get started or get committed to making your flexibility a priority then these classes could be perfect for you!

Our bodies usually allow us more range of motion where we are strong & can demonstrate control so these classes work on strengthening muscles that allow us into positions like the middle split, front splits and bridge through the range of motion & aswell as stretching.

-
Had some great chats in my dms yesterday about adult gymnastics. Many of the conversations were about how many people wanted to try it but just had no idea where to start but also...
X - Not wanting to go alone
X- Fear of being a beginner & being the worst
X- Fear of falling & embarrassment 
X - Not knowing how to structure an open session by themselves
X- Not even knowing adult gymnastics was a thing. 
X- Feeling like their body wasn’t physically ready for the demands of gymnastics (not flexible, strong, fit enough) 
-
I use adult gymnastics as a general term here but open gym sessions are home to calisthenics athletes, parkour athletes, martial artists, cheerleaders, trickers of all levels & in my experience everyone is lovely. It’s a community of people who just really love training & pushing the limits of what’s possible with their bodies.
-
As a beginner that might seem daunting but I can promise you that the majority of people there started learning as adults too & are happy to have a chat, encourage you & give you some tips. We are all too worried about trying to not fall on our own face than if you fall on yours & if you do, someone will be right there to help you up & encourage you to go again.

-
Okay so something I introduced a little while ago when training my middle splits & also teaching is the horse stance squat. I’m flexible enough to get into my middle splits but I’m not very strong there so this has been a game changer. 
-
When you think of it a middle split is a very wide & very low squat & you can see how it really does start to look like a middle split. Obviously you start with legs a lot closer together & when you can do sets where hips go below knees & chest is up  you can take legs wider. 
-
I have loved playing around with these over the last month. I like to pause at the bottom for 3-5 seconds for maybe 10-15 reps. Usually I go bodyweight but have started playing around with some external load & here is where I’m currently at!

The reason we are bad at things, is probably because we haven’t spent a lot of time doing them. If you haven’t given your flexibility ANY attention for years , you aren’t going to have great flexibility because you haven’t been using it. You cannot then expect to undo years of not using a range of motion in a month or 2 through 1 ‘mobility flow’ a week.
-
If you want to IMPROVE something, you need to do it above the level you use it everyday & you need to do it consistently. So if you do want to improve your flexibility above your current level be honest with yourself about what your goals actually are, what your starting point is & how much time you can dedicate to achieving that goal.  With realistic expectations in check, start chipping away at it for a few months & then re asses.
-
It’s one thing I’ve had to drill into myself lately with my training & I had to ask myself ‘have I earned the right to be disappointed with my results’. i had to ask myself whether I was trying that hard & consistently showing up & sometimes i had to hold my hands up like nah I didn’t & that’s totally okay. Training should be for life &’it’s a process & some of it is ugly but consistency will always win🙌🏼",,,,0,0,7.04
